                        <p>There is probably no organization on Earth that operates as illegally as the WORLD FEDERATION of MENTAL HEALTH.</p>

<p>This psychiatric front group, advocating injury and death for the insane, anyone they wish to seize and pronounce "insane," is a fly-by-night corporation and registered to do business in Delaware, the US state where corporations are given with no questions asked.</p>

<p>But it does not do any business in Delaware. It was not<br>used to operate illegally in Switzerland.</p>

<p>When reproached for overlooking its illegal status, the Health Minister for Switzerland (all these "Health Ministers" are connected to the WFMH ring) said it was all right for it to be illegal but it wasn't all right for anyone else to be illegal. Wonderful.</p>

<p>It is presently in Scotland where it discovered it would entail very heavy fines to do business there and if the crime were discovered registered either. 1 has no right.</p>

<p>In fact, it is heavily engaged.</p>

<p>Although it isn't a legal organization in politics and appoints most of the Health Ministers in the world and influences elections, it makes no report of campaign contributions.</p>

<p>Its "directors" have some dizzy personal retirement scheme in addition to a fantastic salary of 17,000 a year. All this is paid for by local contributions to "help the starving insane."</p>

<p>This group's members are other groups, making a secret network over the world.</p>

<p>The member groups call themselves "National," whereas they are illegal as they are not part of any government, they just tastely state they are. This is private profit-making groups.</p>

<p>There is only one national mental health activity in the world that is part of a government. This is the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, USA.</p>

<p>Through this one official agency, these false groups and their secret center, the WFMH, are supported by government graft funds.</p>

<p>The US government hands out vast sums to organize the WFMH "congresses." These are attended by Russian and Iron Curtain country delegates.</p>

<p>The man who keeps up the WFMH front in the United Nations is a "Curtis Roosevelt," but his name is not Roosevelt, but Dow, and he is financed by huge munitions combine.</p>

<p>This international network pushes dope, advocates death and easy seizure.</p>

<p>Their couriers fly over the world continually arranging new ways to influence legislation and keep their resident directors informed.</p>

<p>Their activities in the US are unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The reason government agencies do not act against them is that they control, by holding wives and daughters as hostages, many political figures.</p>

<p>This is the group and network which spreads the lies and instigates actions against Scientology and its people.</p>

<p>This group is seeking to suppress every beneficial treatment of the insane, to eradicate all boundaries and constitutions, to spread dope and seize anyone who disagrees.</p>

<p>The Intelligence service of the Third Reich was composed mainly of doctors if you care to look up the list of Hitler's agencies.</p>

<p>The technology they advocate is Russian in origin but is forbidden to be used in Russia.</p>

<p>There probably is no more illegal group on the planet.</p>

<p>If their program of "Mental Health" is closely examined it will be found to be curiously like the plans of Stain and Hitler, complete with seizures in the night, weird experimental surgery and death camps.</p>

<p>The only organization that is making any progress against these people is Scientology.</p>

<p>Scientologists have exposed them, have made them afraid. Seven out of twelve of their top leaders are now no longer functioning. Their incomes has fallen to a point where representatives in charge of the fund collection drive are whining that the WFMH is going bankrupt.</p>

<p>There is probably no more hated figure in the world today than the psychiatrist.</p>

<p>When this illegal and preposterous network set as its target the eradication of the only new Western development in the field of the mind, they made a fatal mistake.</p>

<p>Politicians still bow to their will are also making a mistake.</p>

<p>Organizations like the WFMH went out of style the day the world learned of Dachau and other Nazi death camps.</p>

<p>The public is wholly on the side of Scientology.</p>

<p>This has been a fight to the death.</p>

<p>The WFMH is dying.</p>
