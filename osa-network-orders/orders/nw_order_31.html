                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>The cause of war is incompetent government. The US does not have the will, really, to handle or clear up its strikes and its differences. It does not have the mental technology with which to do this. It does not have the organizational technology with which to do this. These are blank pages in Man’s history. He doesn’t know how to do them.</p>

<p>The failures of all civilizations are political failures. Sicily, with a hundred and sixty cities, went completely to dust one hundred years before Christ. It was still very rich and worth looting, but that was the end of the Greek civilization in the Mediterranean. The high tide of the Roman Empire was just beginning to actually was not reached for several decades after that. Barbarians had very little to do with wiping out that civilization.</p>

<p>Civilization after civilization has disappeared off this planet on the same note: they cannot handle their political affairs.</p>

<p>Our problem is continuing this civilization long enough to audit out its engram. We are interested in its borders and when that is no longer anything really effective can be done. When you have a government which is the principal and most powerful law and order inside it because it may terminate itself before has the will to provide nation on the planet, coming right over the hill is war.</p>

<p>In its final agonies and disappearance, usually a nation involves itself in one long, prolonged, continuous war. It does not win these wars; it keeps losing them and losing them. But it has enough force and power to enturbulate every other nation on the planet. And unfortunately they happen to be armed with a bomb which has an overkill of one thousand times for every man, woman and child on the planet.</p>

<p>Our primary enemy is not the United States. We don’t have any enemies actually. We’ve got a few suppressives but they are not really enemies of ours. They are surrounded by Martians, stuck on the track with Martians attacking them and they identify all the beings around them as some weird personality. They are trying to be safe on the first dynamic or even trying to destroy their own first dynamic while trying to do something to all the other dynamics. It’s an inverse picture.</p>

<p>Therefore, our next mission will be to buy time for the planet. That is an awfully big chunk to bite. The political objective in which we are involved is to provide an auditing environment in which the engram on the fourth dynamic can be audited. I don’t think that you ever saw an auditor able to audit an engram in a room which had disappeared by a bomb blast.</p>
