                        <p>You will find that some enemies are running a racket and utilizing the judicial system in a sort of blackmail scheme.</p>

<p>With false affidavits and allegations (and they are false) and with the tactic of placing and withdrawing counts of bad nuisance coverage, they have worked out a basis of harassment. They now feel they have media value. Thus it would seem to them that we would pay off to rid them. Yet none of these false sworn testifiers have gone to jail for perjury and the media is lapping up their lies.</p>

<p>Admittedly the legal system has its faults but there are remedies for such tactics as the enemy is using. Their plan is, "if we keep harassing them, sooner or later they'll cough up." So they just prolong things in any way they can.</p>

<p>Perjury, abuse of process, they are civil. But I think even the press would any judge would let this go if he knew about it, and criminal matters. I wonder that continue to play ball with them if they saw what the enemy was doing, for they invite libel and worse for themselves.</p>

<p>A summary of the usage of perjury and abuse of practice and crookedness of the enemy may not be the subject of a campaign. Courts do not like to be conned as the enemy is doing.</p>

<p>Of course you have your own strategies and you are seeking long-term proof-up against such enemies as it would be a continuing situation with others unless you had summary judgments to block such in the future. And this is fine.</p>

<p>But I see what the enemy is doing and it is, to say the least, nothing but massive harassment for blackmail, hoping the Church would pay up to get them off its back. And, if this is true, then there may be legal ways to shut their water and they could be made into historic examples of the illegality of this tactic. It is, indeed, abuse of process and, in fact, a criminal activity to extort money in return for ceasing to harass. The 1920s racketeer did the same thing. Only now attorneys and plaintiffs do it through the courts. They will drag it out as long as they can until legally hit for it.</p>

<p>Harassment through the courts will not end so long as the enemy's prime strategy is not to end in hopes they can extort money to end their harassment of us. The remedy would be very broad exposure of this whole scheme to the courts. Put them on trial, not us.</p>

<p>Those attorneys and plaintiffs alike are just conspirators in an extortion racket and should be so seen and handled. This is in addition to making it very expensive for the opposition to continue.</p>
