                        <p><strong>BATTLE TACTICS</strong><br>Marketing Series 4<br>**SURVEYS ARE THE<br>KEY TO STATS**<br>By the rules of war there is a "reciprocal" factor. Reciprocal means "interchange performed, experienced or felt".<br>A attacks B. B, provoked, now reciprocates. This is called "Reciprocal 1". B’s counter attack is again returned by A. This is "Reciprocal 2". B re-attacks. This is "Reciprocal 3". And so on.<br>Example: In the UK we were heavily attacked. We reciprocated. This was "Reciprocal 1". We won it. But had we continued the attack we would have been bound to have gotten "Reciprocal 2".<br>To avoid "reciprocal 2" we completely shifted our basis of operation. We set up an attacking point – campaign to abolish psychiatry and take the medical doctor out of mental healing.<br>Therefore, in areas which are still in the stage of Reciprocal 1 and are not yet won, we should continue our own heavy attack. In areas where we have visibly won Reciprocal 1, we should shift to setting up attacking points in the form of campaigns to abolish psychiatry and take the medical doctor out of mental healing. These points of attack should be set up rapidly and expertly.<br>Other less violently contested activities should be moved into, as determined by survey, and conducted flagrantly.<br>The rule is that whatever, by survey, the public is buying, should be pushed for rid of it abuses.<br>Example: We find Word Clearing is a popular career booster. We campaign for an eradication of barriers to the education of the young.<br>As any such action will follow a survey that is proven by buying at the org, it will also be found true that eradicating abuses in that field, real or imagined, will be a popular attack action.<br>A lesson that we begin to win when we begin to attack must not be forgotten. But to attack past a major win on any subject or target can bring about a desperation to Reciprocal 2.<br>To follow this planning should bring the Church to higher and higher points of popularity without making any more opposition than is necessary.<br>There is a skill in knowing when to engage exactly. This is PR or intelligence. There is also a high skill in finding what to disengage. This is determined by the degree of wan required. Then there is a skill in finding out what to shift to next in a round. LRH ED 161 INT (70) discusses HCO PL Sept. 79, Marketing Series 4, SURVEY-EYES, THE KEY TO AT(S); gives you the exact tech of this; then there is the skill in shifting one’s operation over to the new target without losing momentum and organization built up with the last target.<br>This is what you must solve in areas where we have won against attacks.</p>
