The results can be quite catastrophic.</p>

<p>An instance of this was an earlier Legal unit which was handling a case that could have been easily fought and handled. But they didn’t demand that attorneys come up with handlings and solve the problems on this particular case. Instead they made up their minds about some solution to resolve anything. They ended up with solutions that would have aided the enemy. Didn’t send anything, asked the attorneys for an expensive opinion on it which went to the executive and then not gotten on the lines, this matter could have torpedoed the whole case. This was a sight thing. Looking into Legal unit it was found that the staff members of that unit were PTS as well. They failed to develop a proper defense and attack line. Their executives had let them go that far without forcing them to get the matter properly handled.</p>

<p>Therefore, an executive has to be aware at all times of staff on external lines who are handling situations. They can go PTS. It’s up to the executive not to go PTS. The executive has to keep pushing and has to override any nuttiness. That is actually the solution.</p>

<p>One of the tricks is for the executive to be harder to confront than the situation Legal or PR is handling. Executives have to make the consequences of not handling it much worse than the situation itself.</p>

<p>It’s up to executives, always, to handle our Legal- and PR- type terminals and get them in there confronting it.</p>
