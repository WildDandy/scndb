                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>The US scene differs slightly from the UK and Commonwealth scene in that it has different problems and slightly different values. As per a recent ethnic survey, 49% in the US favor freedom of speech, religion, press; and the largest percents are against government (of ethnic, the formula for freedom in the US is:</p>

<p><strong>CLAIM CREDIT FOR ADVANCES IN REESTABLISHING FREEDOM IN THE US AND PUSH ACTIONS TO DO SO AND CLAIM CREDIT FOR UNMASKING GOVERNMENT HYPOCRISY AND ACT TO DO SO.</strong></p>

<p>The keynote is that the support of Scientology is the support of freedom and a blow at government hypocrisy.</p>

<p>If you examine this policy in depth with imagination, you will see at once that it is adaptable to any of the current zones of interest. Watch carefully the zones of maximum public interest and flow with these.</p>

<p>Dope, sex, education are the contemporary US hot spots. Quite honestly only Dianetics and Scientology can resolve these problems. The psychiatrist and psychologist are portrayed as agents of fruitless government attempts to <strong>CONTROL</strong> and deny freedom to the public and violate their rights.</p>

<p>Our position is that if every government official and agency was personally answerable for violating the Constitution and Bill of Rights all would be peaceful, prosperous and happy again.</p>

<p>The Russian psychology and psychiatry, introduced into schools are causing the riots.</p>

<p>The Russian seeks to dominate education; Students are revolting against that, and spirit.</p>

<p>We are the foremost Western development in workable technology of the mind and spirit.</p>

<p>All you have to do as a Scientologist is advocate freedom for the individual, equal rights under law, true constitutional government and a belief in the destiny of mankind and humanity.</p>

<p>There is no insanity but there are people in the suppressed agony of physical illnesses neglected in hospitals.</p>

<p>We expose influences hostile to America.</p>

<p>We cooperate with and do not antagonize city and state police. These, we maintain, are good people who get the duty despite corrupt political efforts at the top. In short, we work actively to get their police on the side of the people.</p>

<p>We also work to get the armed forces on the side of the people. It is plainly demonstrated only top politicians have fought us. Police over the world try to stay neutral about us.</p>

<p>Every corrupt politician, we say, "See what the Scientologists did." Every exposure of win to improve freedom, we say, "See what the Scientologists did." Every accomplish and all data and news exposes what we publish in the US Freedom should accomplish one or another of these points.</p>

<p>This gives a plain visible conflict. The universities in Russia to be governed by churches. We, an American development, are fought by Russian psychology and psychiatry and are governed now by Russian mental technology, so the students revolt.</p>

<p>"We have the answers." You don’t have to say what answers we have. You add one way or another to main items that we have the right answers to. This we say again and again.</p>

<p>"We are only fought because we are totally effective." We say this over and over in various ways.</p>

<p>Within this framework you can develop many themes.</p>

<p>The present Scientology campaign is a crusade to bring better health to the world. You see this in our Dianetic program. We will push this hard in orgs. It is not Freedom material.</p>

<p>Later in this year we will push a whole new school-college, study-teach reformation program. This Freedom material so we build up how bad it is in colleges, dope, sex, psychiatric and psychological trends working on students to wreck America.</p>

<p>In Freedom, bill the Scientologists as bylines unless told to do so specifically. Omit the stress on me personally and do not use my bylines unless you imply Scientologists are not true of The Auditor. It is true of Freedom in any land. You simply Scientologists are all over the place, and they are. So long as you stress only the enemy propaganda efforts, they are far more able to confront. You don’t want me in your propaganda. You want him suppressed. Get it?</p>

<p>Please study this and give us some heavy propaganda wins.</p>
