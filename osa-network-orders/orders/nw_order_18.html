written by LRH circa 1969.)</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>Having been driven out of Switzerland by its pressures and reduced finance, the "World" Federation of Mental Health removed various offices in 1968 to Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>Its local and most active British confederate is the "National" Association for Mental Health, c/o Miss Appleby, 39 Queen Anne Street, London, W.I. This is said to be the largest of their confederates, having 78 employees.</p>

<p>The Vice President of this group had on a tour of foreign and Russian mental hospitals financed for him by the UK and Robinson. He repaid this by giving Minister of Health of the UK. This was Kenneth Robson on the strength of them made them 10,000 pounds of government funds.</p>

<p>His forwarding of the group’s actions and programs has been continual. He was eventually removed from office for unpopularity with his own constituency and failures on post.</p>

<p>Two agents of the WFMH are continually assigned as "ministry observers" to the ministries of Education and of Health. In 1966 these were I.D. Llewellyn for the Department of Education and Science and a G. Tooth for Health. In 1968, Dr. T.K. Whitmore was their agent in the Ministry of Education and G. Tooth remained as the Ministry of Health agent.</p>

<p>The ministries have recently been combined. Robinson ousted. Crossman, the new minister of the combined ministries immediately followed the same attack lines of the WFMH. He does not seem to be connected but his data would be given him by the agents in the ministries. However, Crossman is a fellow member of the Fabians with Robinson.</p>

<p>The UK "National" Association of course has no faintest right to the word "National" as it is not a government agency and the use of the word contravenes the UK Companies Act of 1948!</p>

<p>This "National" group has done a remarkable job of big name collection and hides under patronage from very elevated places.</p>

<p>Cecil King and Sir William Carr are the channels of newspaper chains which handle their press propaganda.</p>

<p>Cecil King apparently ceased to be cooperative some short time ago, his press suddenly ceased to carry the WFMH message. At the same time he came under violent "government" attack and Crossman has become very hostile to him.</p>

<p>Lord Balniel was the first one to attack Scientology in Parliament. He is head of the Kensington chapter of the "National" Association and is in used local Borough funds to support this chapter of a private group. His wife has their hands and he is continually worried about her.</p>

<p>The WFMH now has its strongest forces centered in England and Scotland and from there is managing its confederate organizations in the US, South Africa and Commonwealth.</p>

<p>There is an oddity in the WFMH which follows its orders uniformly. Thus one control of the Rhodesia political scene zones of influence as it seems to be in complete control of the names of the line than the actual government of the UK.</p>

<p>Some of different control "National" UK directors including King and Carr were highly respected and their advice followed by the Minister of Tourism and Information, J. Howman of Rhodesia.</p>

<p>This group has a heavy control into South Africa through their association there and the SA Information service seems dominated by them.</p>

<p>The assassin of Verwoerd strangely enough passed directly from the hands of a member of this group straight into the State House, bypassing even the Special Branch and killed Verwoerd. There was a lot of this in the SA press which was suddenly hushed up.</p>

<p>Several famous deaths and incidents trace back to persons in the hands of members of this group. The Texas tower gunman’s entire plan (to go to the University of Texas high tower and kill people with a rifle) was known to a member of this group’s associates but was not prevented by him and he informed no one.</p>

<p>Such assassinations and incidents are beyond the scope of purely business investigation. But it seems in many major incidents an assassin was just before the act in the hands of a member of this group. The group spokesmen explain it all away very glibly, saying, "He was insane of course he was in the hands of a group member." Coincidence is however too frequent.</p>

<p>Even the defection of the two British government officials (Burgess and MacLean) traces to a member of this group in Washington DC.</p>

<p>One can ask the question wryly that if this group knew at once business or knew or could do anything about the mind really, how it is released its such dangerous lunatics in such a high percentage of political or social crimes.</p>

<p>The central control of all such activities is now fully and newly concentrated in England.</p>

<p>Pinpointing further attacks on Scientology are from persons of either political party but such persons trace back to the "National" Association for Mental Health as the common denominator or to persons in close association with its members.</p>

<p>It would take a far more professional and much larger scale investigation than a church could ever do to disclose just how far all this goes, what its actual heads are. But evidence to hand is clear-cut and positive.</p>

<p>All attacks on Scientology directly to the "National" group in England. The "National" group leads to their lead group in other countries. And the full current whole authors of all attacks on Scientology to this World group confederates are the program originated at the "World" group’s last congress in London in the summer of 1968.</p>

<p>One could assume innocent rivalry except that the "World" group pretends and collects money under false pretenses, that it does illegally murder "patients," that numerous national or public crime trace back to its practitioners and that the wives or families of this is explained away by lofty arguments.</p>

<p>None of too many politicians are in their hands about "highly trained," "authorities," connections to the best people." If these were all true the problems would be lessening instead of increasing.</p>

<p>The police in the West in many courts are in direct conflict with individual members of this group defending or releasing criminals as "mental experts." Thus the matter is also definitely to police interest, whatever other crimes there may be.</p>

<p>Full documentary evidence exists that the libel and slander fed to other governments to crush Scientology comes from the main body in England and is programmed there. The full evidence on this is in the hands of Scientology organizations but is to be presented only in court as the WFMH is brought to trial.</p>

<p>However, this brief, as it applies to the police, is not therefore though it documents the evidence is not a request to the police to defend Scientology and such includes seizure and murder of Scientologists against Scientology, even included in this brief.</p>

<p>This is a request from citizens of your country to do your duty as a police official and investigate, apprehend and arrest members of the "World" and "National" "Mental Health" groups for statue crimes against the people and the state already evidenced herein and obvious to any investigator.</p>

<p>No group on Earth has the right to commit seizure of person, mayhem, manslaughter and murder and there is no law in your country that in any way condones it.</p>

<p>The crime even of obtaining money under false pretenses amounting as it does to millions, is too great to be ignored, no matter how many "best names" may unwittingly be involved in what must be the largest "con game" in history.</p>

<p>It might be wise to call in the military on this matter as they are well trained in purely intelligence matters and may themselves have evidence hitherto not related or coordinated. And also, it might be doubly wise as public commotion has already begun on this subject.</p>

<p>When the enemy goes so far as to exhibit on TV the torturing and the physical injury of a "mental patient" and depriving him of his remaining wits, as was recently done in New Zealand by members of this "World" "mental health" group, it has gone well beyond public tolerance.</p>
