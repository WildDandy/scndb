                        <p>Over the years we have been running into a criminal conspiracy to injure, maim or destroy our organizations.</p>

<p>The enemy has been pushing plants into the organizations and possibly has been giving them orders to do certain things. Whether these orders were done or not is beside the point.</p>

<p>Any outside agency or person actively contributing money to any such attack is not just guilty of conspiracy, but much worse—the crime is that of actual instigation.</p>

<p>There are two ways one ferrets out a spy network—or finds a spy—and these are: communication lines and finances. There is only a third one which is accident.</p>

<p>If made the subject of depositions the least that would happen is it would throw an ugly color over the enemy and a moderate success is that they contradict themselves and trip up and give leads. A total success would be a breakdown on their part that they have engaged in such activities. And, if it had ever developed from any other quarter and they had denied in their depositions having so acted or conspired, you would have them on perjury.</p>

<p>The exact point you want is <strong>financial support</strong>. It is this point of <strong>financial support</strong> that is in question. Checkbooks and bank accounts can be subpoenaed for verification.</p>

<p>If the financial support connections can be found and proved, you have not only busted the conspiracy but you have also opened the door to recompense for damages.</p>

<p>All <strong>prosecution requires</strong> for definitely predictable results—hard evidence, and hard evidence of course is contained in the areas of communications and financial records. These can only be masked to a limited degree and there are too many points of receipt and registry for them to be entirely covered up.</p>

<p>These are the two frail points of any conspiracy.</p>

<p>This is a piece of technology in its purest and most basic form and it should be applied to the legal sector.</p>

<p>So push it.</p>
