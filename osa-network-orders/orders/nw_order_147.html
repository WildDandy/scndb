                    </div>

                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>A very important survey has just been done which shows in its first sector (West US) that psychology at least in a fascist police state origin begun in Germany and, psychiatry, of course, that was sector has laid a colossal egg.</p>

<p>With communism making considerable gains in the world, there is a tendency on the part of nations to become police states or fascism. Psychology and psychiatry can be regarded as conditioning processes which hopefully aim a population toward a police state. This is not a light conclusion. This is borne out by a rather exhaustive study of the origins of these subjects, which go back, by the way, to 1809 and the University of Berlin.</p>

<p>The last thing we want anything to do with is a police state. Efforts in the and direction of trying to start revolutions within those failed all during World War II, we have consistently failed since, whether the police state was communism or fascism.</p>

<p>Therefore, the last thing we want anything to do with is psychology. Yet this subject is uniformly being taught to teachers, students and even little kids throughout the western world, and seems to continue to get appropriations and a push.</p>

<p>It and psychiatry lie directly across our advancement line.</p>

<p>From the survey results, it can be noticed that education is a keynote and does hit some of the international buttons. Self-improvement philosophy shows up well on the first dynamic. But the pay-off is that psychology shows up as being extremely, densely, completely and absolutely unpopular.</p>

<p>This gain is a notable one and in the right direction. We already have some operations going on to de-finance psychology and psychiatry, but we are not pushing psychology hard enough.</p>

<p>As to popularity, anyone who tried to fight psychology down at this time would find himself very popular. Therefore, it is an excellent whipping boy according to this survey.</p>

<p>At the present time, a great deal of money is being appropriated to schools in the United States and elsewhere which is being resisted by the population. It would be a good idea to say that useless subjects should be deleted from the curriculum and that this would save people money. Psychology then shows up as the most popular point to hit.</p>

<p>In other words, at the risk of no loss of public confidence, you can apparently undermine totalitarian inclined newspapers even evidently a sheer subject, without the somewhat nasty business you please. Because it is bracing. Psychology does nothing, it can cure nobody. All it all is degrade. It even is not that it cannot change anybody, and so can be said to be a useless subject.</p>

<p>The subject originally was taken from religion - a sort of a theft sometime in the 19th Century. And you can argue that it should be returned to which where it belongs.</p>

<p>Certainly this survey opens the door to an attack line religion would be very popular that it was the Australian British Psychology Association’s, but have never forgotten you naturally and normally attack those who are attacking us. £50,000 that composed the “coaching for witnesses” that was used in the Melbourne inquiry. So don’t get the idea that these people are not dangerous. They are.</p>

<p>It is in our best interest to prevent a police state from occurring in any of these areas. So any preparation educationally to open the door to one should of course be attacked and should go.</p>
