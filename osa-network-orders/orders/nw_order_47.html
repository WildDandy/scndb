                        <p>Lisa O’Krackel, the Mata Hari of our times, came aboard as the wife of Bill O’Krackel, made trouble, blew, was seen ashore hanging around for a week in Corfu, got $1,600 from her mother and left the area.</p>

<p>She ‘married’ Bill. In the meantime she worked as a ‘pro’ in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Turns out she was married before to a Greek in Greece, was not divorced before she ‘married’ Bill.</p>

<p>She has six aliases (different names) and possibly three passports, one in her maiden name, one as the Greek’s wife and one as Bill’s ‘wife’.</p>

<p>We guess that Bill found out about her former marriage and no divorce and possibly that’s why she blew.</p>

<p>We don’t know that she was here for info but for sure some wild, left wing characters in the press are trying to talk about a disappeared girl and had the crust to ask the Deputy Prime Minister of Greece about the ‘disappeared girl’ and ‘what ship in Corfu.’ The Deputy Prime Minister said our ship was okay and he’d “look into the girl matter.”</p>

<p>Well, we’re also looking into it. We mean her no harm. But her blow is causing Dev-1. Looks like another ‘Linda Smith’ plant.</p>

<p>I just realized (and issued a news story) that in each “Scientology breaks up marriages’ story, it was a psychiatrist who did it. They go see the parents, bring pressure. In two cases (Linda Smith and Karen Henslow) the girl was enticed home, electric shocked and terrorized into breaking it up. Henslow was only engaged to be married. Linda was married.</p>

<p>So that’s an interesting twist, isn’t it. They do it, say we do it and then demand an inquiry.</p>

<p>Boy, the odor is sure appalling.</p>

<p>We save tons of marriages every year.</p>

<p>1 Linda Smith (Hicks) was a staff member in the SO for a very short time and was found to be a plant. She blew and after returning home, was put under psychiatric treatment and stirred up some enheta media in the UK.</p>
