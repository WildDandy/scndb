                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>The case of WILHELM REICH is a very interesting case. His "Orgone Therapy" theory "was under constitutional law illegally in contempt of court" by the FDA in the '50s and died mysteriously shortly after in prison. The FDA order was a masterpiece of unconstitutional law.</p>

<p>Reich fled to get in 1933. He was an expert in small energies and a qualified MD. The Nazis wowed Hitler even. They did. In the early 1950s, via the FDA, nearly seven years after the collapse of Hitler.</p>

<p>Charlie Chaplin, the comedian, made the movie *The Great Dictator*. Nazi agents swore to get Charlie. Ugly things happened to the producer and others. In the 1950s immigration agents still had Chaplin falsely listed as a communist and were still hitting at him.</p>

<p>Here are two cases which suggest that the Nazi spy rings stayed in place after WW II.</p>

<p>There may be many more.</p>

<p><strong>IN PLACE NAZIS</strong></p>

<p>The Gehlen Organization of West Germany was a military intelligence group independently formed by General Gehlen during the last days of WW II.</p>

<p>Gehlen hid out, watched for US troops in the mountains.</p>

<p>The CIA took over Gehlen and his in place Russian network and continued to operate it in Russia.</p>

<p>This shows a Nazi spy network still in place and operating after WW II.</p>

<p><strong>NAZI INFLUENCE</strong></p>

<p>Leon G. Turrou was the FBI agent who broke up a pre-WW II spy ring in the US. The spies: Rurick, Miss Hoffman, Voss and Glaser were found guilty of monstrous espionage crimes in federal court in the US and sentenced to years in prison. But the attacks made on Nazi spies in America (Random House, 1939), so violent were recounted in his book, *Nazi and So Great* (one must infer) the influence of other Nazis in the government that Turrou was forced to resign from the FBI after conducting one of its most brilliant cases.</p>

<p>The inertia of the FBI in arresting psychiatrists or Nazis, guilty of mayhem and murder during recent years, has struck us as odd.</p>

<p>This case tends to indicate that Nazi influence in the US was very great and very political.</p>

<p>In 1941 the US Congress was of a mind Hitler was someone you could do business with. Only the Pearl Harbor affair got the US government into the war.</p>

<p><strong>FRAUD</strong></p>

<p>The National Association of Mental Health in Los Angeles collects "charity funds." It never turns over to charity.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice of California has the evidence. It does not act.</p>

<p>These funds go into millions. They are used to lobby for more funds from Congress that also vanish.</p>

<p>An intelligence group needs funds and it needs funds one cannot account for.</p>

<p>The NAMH was formed by Beers under pressure from the psychiatrist Adolph Meyer in 1931. This organization over the world pushes Nazi doctrine.</p>

<p>Its funds vanish.</p>

<p>It is politically connected in every government.</p>

<p>It is oddly immune.</p>

<p>"National" is a Nazi use word. Fascism is always "National" according to Oswald Mosely, the British Fascist, in his *new* book.</p>

<p><strong>BANKING</strong></p>

<p>A few hours after writing the Banking Hypothesis, word came that West Germany had attacked and devalued the US dollar.</p>

<p>This is one of the four main lines, according to the theory worked out.</p>

<p><strong>DRUGS</strong></p>

<p>Big drug firms, possible ex-Nazis still in place, make more than their quota of hard drugs, export them and smuggle them back into the US.</p>

<p>They aute peculiarities in domine from attack. A congressional hearing found this. Narcotics authorities have done nothing.</p>

<p>It takes political control of an intelligence nature—blackmail, etc., to work so smoothly.</p>

<p>Psychiatrists shovel out drugs, LSD, etc. Nothing happens to them.</p>

<p><strong>MAFIA</strong></p>

<p>The Mafia is Italian. It is in the drug business.</p>

<p>It is anti-government. *But* Italy was Fascist and was the original Fascist country. Germany took over Italian intelligence out of exasperation.</p>

<p>The Mafia was available for cooperation during and after WW II.</p>

<p>Most city police forces are said to be paid off by Mafia gangsters.</p>

<p>The Mafia has a huge financial empire, hotels, resorts, etc.</p>

<p>They operate strangely immune.</p>

<p>There may be no connection whatever with Nazi intelligence.</p>

<p>But they must not be overlooked.</p>

<p>They have never been on our lines.</p>

<p>Yet they fulfill a Fascist program of bringing a country to its knees by widespread drug use.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIAL REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p>Rudolf Hess studied Japanese intelligence for 17 years and then applied its methods to German intelligence.</p>

<p>The Japanese infiltrate social groups and get them fighting each other and the government.</p>

<p>In this resulting turmoil they take over.</p>

<p>This was a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere technique.</p>

<p><strong>US EVILS</strong></p>

<p>The US is suffering from:</p>

<p>1. Economic decay. This is an intelligence target. The West Germans just gave it a heavy push.</p>

<p>2. Drug abuses. This is an intelligence-medical target to destroy the culture and future leaders.</p>

<p>3. Anti-war riots. This is an intelligence target - the destruction of the will to fight.</p>

<p>4. Psychiatric death camps and psychiatric abuses. The organizations advocating these are directly connected to Nazi movements.</p>

<p>The Nazi networks could be active on these lines. Evidence is now piling up that they are.</p>

<p><strong>DOCTORS</strong></p>

<p>The fantastic overuse of the title doctor is peculiar to Nazis. Dr. Goebbels, Dr. this, doctor that. Their strongest espionage networks pre-WW II were run by doctors.</p>

<p><strong>LEIPZIG</strong></p>

<p>The University of Leipzig is the birthplace of Nazi doctrine. "Man is an animal." Prof. Wundt, 1879, first advanced this theory. Practically every man of note in the field of the mind came from Leipzig University. Pavlov, Dewey, and a host of others all came from or went through this university.</p>

<p>It is now in East Germany.</p>

<p>It forms a trace point for checking careers.</p>

<p><strong>DOCUMENTS</strong></p>

<p>The documentation backing up these theories is already terrific. It must be added to rapidly.</p>

<p>The background books are many.</p>

<p>Nuremberg trials records are explicit. They definitely prove psychiatry made Hitler and the death camps.</p>

<p>The World Federation of Mental Health and the National Association of Mental Health are proven to be of Nazi origin. Their literature continues to push racial purity, mayhem and murder.</p>

<p><strong>BEST PEOPLE</strong></p>

<p>The Nazi personal target was the snob. Von Ribbentrop and the Cliveden set of England are an example.</p>

<p>This characteristic still exists in the WFMH and NAMH.</p>

<p>Arrogance, control of the masses, dominance, are hallmarks of both Nazis and the best people.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIAL GROUPS</strong></p>

<p>The Nazis invented social groups as intelligence circles. Societies, professional societies, clubs all speak of the German fixation on organizing.</p>

<p>These Nazi founded groups are still in place in England. The Eugenics Society, the Euthanasia Society were Nazi founded and are still operating. They advocate Nazi measures. "Eugenics" as a subject is Nazi.</p>

<p>They connect back to the WFMH.</p>

<p>So, now, does the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association. These tie in with the drug network and are largely supported by (journal advertising).</p>

<p><strong>CHARACTER ATTACKS</strong></p>

<p>The Nazis brought personal character destruction up to a fine art in its propaganda activities.</p>

<p><strong>DAILY MAIL</strong></p>

<p>The late unlamented London *Daily Mail* was the subject of a secret order in Churchill's time. In some way it was pro-Nazi. This hearing and these facts were not made public but specially reserved when a lot on Scientology rolling in the period were made public.</p>

<p>This was the paper that kept the attacks on Scientology documents in the UK.</p>

<p>It went broke, like the *Saturday Evening Post* and like *Time* is going.</p>

<p><strong>PENETRATION</strong></p>

<p>Penetration is always a win. We have made it in finding WHO attacks Scientology from where by doing what.</p>

<p>This gives us an even further penetration. We have found as well the ex-intelligence officer mouth pieces in the UK that influence that government and push Nazi aims.</p>

<p>We are getting even further penetration now into who is keeping this planet upset.</p>
