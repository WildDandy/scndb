                        <p>I have begun to understand what has happened to Scientology at large. They are afraid of us. They are actually terrified at human beings and they do not know the degree of potential or power we violate these beings and it scares them spitless. And one of the things that scares them spitless is that some of these guys, in obsessed fixed positions of bngness, one of the idea is, to he should remain himself, totally unknown while pretending he is "something" else.</p>

<p>In other words, we are violating that the vast majority of thetans are absolutely starved for the idea that they wish to remain unknown. Nobody wants, used to crush. We are on a planet where the population, the fact that was known must recognize one, the whole population and being a thetan, a lot of other planets too. So, the proper solution was to remain totally unknown. And there must not be any such thing as a thetan or a being or anything like that. So we are frightening, we are liable to expose them to view. It isn’t anything with its, their being presence we are liable to expose them to view. It isn’t anything with its, their being presence we are liable to expose them to view.</p>

<p>A covert bunch of cats. And they are also very easily terrified. So I’ve got a better estimate of the society into which we are moving. They should be approached. If they are not, you don’t say it should be soothed, but your sort of “PR” that’s all to soothe them. They should say in these many words, so it’s basic tendency of PR to sight, we’re not going to crazy you. "Just be the many, a friend of ours." "Well, see, because if you become an enemy of ours, why, there is nothing that could help you."</p>

<p>There is some of that in our line now because it is the reality of the situation. We know very well that people who turn against Scientology cave in.</p>

<p>We are actually suffering from a terror reaction. And there is a point between terror and overwhelm because terror will be succeeded by overwhelm. You will have, as time marches on, a whole society in prostration.</p>
