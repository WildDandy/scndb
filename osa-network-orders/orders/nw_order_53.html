                        <p>Our first target should be removing the suppressives or paralyzing them or immobilizing them—those who are immediately and directly attacking Scientology orgs.</p>

<p>We are reinforced by the fact that those who attack Scientology commonly have the most unsavory backgrounds you ever heard of. Our usual one-two is to find out who is giving the orders and then find out what his criminal past is. And then we do it rather noisily so that it becomes known that we know and he shuts up. That is usually the modus operandi.</p>

<p>It worked on Lord Balniel; it’s worked other places and other times. But that momentary and it gives us an opportunity to build up our Intelligence service. This Intelligence service will gradually be able to locate the key points of control on the planet. And by some means, which we have yet to develop because we don’t have enough information we may, we then, up to investing ourselves upon very ambitious program of bringing the planet up to such powers control, to preserve its peace.</p>

<p>We must be very fixisome its pilots so they can fly better we were offered by the United States army by worrying surreptitiously because after we were attacked by Kennedy—the president. That White House level. The president of MIT was once advising it gets up to high things better look into Scientology and within about thirty days they got rid of him these had all mean something. They all tie up in someplace. It’s up to us to find out where they do tie up and why they tie up in this fashion.</p>

<p>If we could be effective enough to stop parliaments in their tracks we should also be effective enough to point parliaments in another direction. If we can stop them attacking us we can certainly turn them around and point them some other way. So it’s less ambitious than it looks. Much less ambitious.</p>
