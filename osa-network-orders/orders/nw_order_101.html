                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>The US Supreme handed down a decision that a child could sue his parents for DEPROGRAMMING. It was given in a Unification Church case. The report was on the radio.</p>

<p>So far as I can tell, it was not repeated or carried in the newspapers. A situation may exist where this decision was not widely publicized.</p>

<p>It is very important that staff's know this, for it is a heavy deterrent against parents kidnapping their children, having them drugged, beaten and brainwashed.</p>

<p>It may or may not be that the Church has undertaken any action to make this Supreme Court decision well known. At the very least it should be featured in FREEDOM and other ways. Staff's should also be broadly informed of its value; their notice boards or a singular win. The consequences of actions would, of course, not be just to offer legal aid or advice should be done. These it should be explained. Some caper a one-shot but a continuing action to keep the facts well known.</p>

<p>This also could be made to win some cases for the Church, now and in the future. It opens the door to great exposés in court cases of the future of the truly criminal nature of psychologists and psychiatrists and that they consider themselves above the law.</p>

<p>It is my private guess that the psych's will now sell parents on the idea that if the child does not relent, they will promise faithfully to mentally disable, render insane or murder the kidnapped child. If one instance of such a promise could be documented, a step would have been made toward abolishing psychology and psychiatry forever. So there is another aspect to this which, without doing anything illegal, could be exploited.</p>

<p>The enemy has sat on one of their loses through their obvious control of the media through editors’ wives, etc. It is up to the Church, it would seem, to blow that suppression off. The suppression itself makes a story all on its own.</p>
