                        <p>The pattern of the World Federation of Mental Health is to have four or five associate groups or affiliates in a country.</p>

<p>Only one of these is the actual working group. It usually has "National" or "Mental Health" as part of its title. These actual confederates collect funds and act as agents provocateurs.</p>

<p>The "National" in the title deludes people into thinking it is government connected and sometimes even the government is fooled. But these confederates have no more connection with the government than the main group has with the United Nations.</p>

<p>By the use of these "connections" both the confederate and main group collect fantastic quantities of money under false pretenses.</p>

<p>The other "member" groups in a country are also other professional groups and their presence hides the confederate group. Quite bona fide members become infiltrated and their opinions colored to give force to any current campaign.</p>

<p>The organization holds "congresses" in various capitals yearly. These have many "closed door" committee meetings for confederates. Russian delegates routinely attend.</p>

<p>This makes a convenient meeting ground for programs and orders.<br>Confederates come away with their briefing and go to work in their countries.</p>

<p>Couriers of the main organization are continually on the move, visiting confederates while attending the conferences of other organizations.</p>

<p>There is a main "board of directors" but it is hard to see how it could ever meet as these are "front men" scattered over the world, often completely innocent professional men.</p>

<p>The real business of the main group is run by an "executive committee," elected by confederates.</p>

<p>The professed advertised targets of the main group and its "national" confederates are kindness, sweetness and light, taken from a book written by Clifford Beers. This man died in 1943 but is carried as an "honorary president" in 1968. His wife is also mentioned as a member. Typical of the con man atmosphere, no mention is made that these people are dead.</p>

<p>The actual group are so far out from stated intentions that it is starting to find members of the activities actually reporting the loud bestial atrocities in their institutions.</p>

<p>The UK confederate member, "The National Association for Mental Health" runs its own private institutions and specializes in the relatives and children of aristocrats.</p>

<p>The income of the organization is retained inside national areas. It is usual to find a confederate group with millions of one man occupying a tiny office that has no mental health activity and no visible way to spend the income. These confederate groups in a country are often manned by local income and typist or two office staff in the office.</p>

<p>The main group, before it was pushed out of Geneva, had only four working staff in the office.</p>

<p>The socio-financial promotion of the group is handled by a Gordon Brown, in New York, who is a charities expert.</p>

<p>A survey of the whole organization finds no visible activity. Apparently nothing is going on in their offices that accounts for huge funds, collections, services, anything. They are like graves. Yet from somewhere in their name there is a fantastic amount of activity. One reaches the conclusion (as he looks at their income and influence) that the actual business of the main organization and its national confederates is not carried on at its advertised addresses and that these do not conduct it.</p>

<p>Their first target in a country is the post of Minister of Health as the only post that could interfere with them. They fill it with one of their own men (i.e., Robinson in England, a former Vice President of their UK confederate) or they obtain a hold on the person’s wife or family. In a "National" body, but without any funds were being poured into their treasury as at least one country (England) national reason or accounting.</p>

<p>Federal funds in the US are similarly diverted on one pretext or another.</p>

<p>This, added to their public subscriptions adds up to hundreds of millions which yet never appear to go anywhere that one can discover from their balance sheets.</p>

<p>Offices that do not "operate" visibly, income that does not go anywhere, "big names connected to it and yet knowing nothing about it, mask a frantic level of activity in terms of couriers that areas handled.</p>

<p>Only the UK national confederate has any staff (78) and they are very closemouthed. They even hide some types of their literature as these will not and it without admitting it exists.</p>

<p>Their actual effect on an area is to degrade its culture and suborn its government.</p>

<p>Their aims, even the visible ones, mainly political. They maintain a close hold on certain members of parliament who speak for them.</p>

<p>On examination, those who speak for them in parliament have either unsavory pasts (Sydney, Australia - Lord Balniel; O.R. Healy, Liberal Member for Wakehursts, New South Wales, Australia member, Mr. Healy, whose wife is in their hands and whose daughter is not legitimate).</p>

<p>A constantly recurring political target is their "Siberia" bill which once passed half through the US Congress and is routinely offered.</p>

<p>By its terms any citizen in a country can be picked up, deprived of civil rights, tortured and killed in a remote stockade. A million acres in Alaska was being set up for this in the 1950s. The bill is currently being offered again in New Zealand.</p>

<p>In operation they act like an intelligence group. They infiltrate with agents, they use agent provocateur press tactics, they use couriers, they have a heavy false cover in the U.N. and "National" groups. Opponents are blackmailed into complaisance or hounded or picked up as "insane" and killed or de-personalized.</p>

<p>Their early Russian secret police methods. The largest shock on this subject is These were "cures" consist of brain "operations"; electric text and convulsive drugs. Russian.</p>

<p>By propaganda they have made these "acceptable" or at least proof against outcry.</p>

<p>Only a scholar would know that these "treatments" are peculiar to intelligence activities—the NKVD, Hitler’s SS, the French, in WWII and Algeria, etc. To tolist them off as mental "treatment" in various countries. Russia demonstrates the intense grip this group has on professional treatments showing any cures but it is peculiar to note, forbids every single one of these, without showing on people uses them on captured agents in Lubyanka Prison.</p>

<p>It is completely understood that this is a lot of evil to confront, almost too much. Yet it is; These actions by the main group, confederate groups in western countries, and in their institutions are going on as this is written.</p>

<p>If one merely checks up on what officials’ wives or families or daughters are in the hands of these people, it is very revealing.</p>

<p>The problem from a police point of view however is elementary:</p>

<p>1. They obtain money under false pretenses. They are neither U.N. nor national in character yet pretend both.</p>

<p>2. There is no law that permits injury or murder regardless of whether the person is sane or insane. It is police prerogative to arrest for manslaughter.</p>

<p>3. Funds are incompletely reported.</p>

<p>4. Blackmail and duress exist against political persons.</p>

<p>5. The groups have corporate irregularities and were not even registered to do business in Switzerland and have misused the word "National" in many confederate groups, this being forbidden in most Companies Acts.</p>

<p>6. They are not registered as foreign agents.</p>

<p>7. Their practitioners violate the laws of rape on female "patients."</p>

<p>These are crimes which are independently actionable without any new legislation and most are statutory crimes in the majority of areas of the West.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there are probably many local crimes and violations on the part of persons who are members of confederate groups.</p>

<p>The temper of the public towards the psychiatric "practitioner" is very bad and despite calmness on the surface public sentiment against this group could suddenly erupt as the people react not mob hysteria when they eventually get the idea that their government is not only in protecting them but condoning murder under the guise of help.</p>

<p>Such a situation can get out of hand suddenly.</p>

<p>For this and other reasons, it is of considerable importance that effective investigation and any indicated action be taken.</p>
