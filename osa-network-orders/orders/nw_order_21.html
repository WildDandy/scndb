                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>There is a current book, <strong>The Spy and His Masters - A Short Course on the Secret War</strong> by Christopher Felix, ex-CIA (published by Secker and Warburg, 14 Carlisle St, Soho Sq, W1, London), which gives the background of modern intelligence. This describes a "covert operation" between organizations such as that being run on us and is a slight portion of the book. The book itself is a very good text and should be required reading for background as it is current as world procedure as opposed to espionage. Security forces in the West are ducs they are still doing the 1914 Plans of the Battlefield approach in security defense. Which is to say they are defending only against agents who steal plans. The agent sent in to ruin a country's culture is totally outside the action of Western security.</p>

<p>The Nats can't—parley—that is now clear. So it becomes obvious they are not free agents but resemble troops who must fight to the bitter end. So we expose the fact that there must be a command centre or a command line.</p>

<p>Their world-over sudden mouthing of the same prearranged PRO phrases—Stander in South Africa using the same defense phrases as somebody in England—shows prearrangement.</p>

<p>As we can find no command personality or haven't so far, it must be outside our reach, say in Moscow or Israel or somewhere. But they have comm lines that tell them what to do. They are often too slow so you catch them stammering now and then as the Nats are now doing.</p>

<p>They are making mistakes and will go on making them unless you permit them to fall back and regroup.</p>

<p>Eight known leaders or sub-leaders are out of it like King. We have a few more to find like Thompson.</p>

<p>We will really pull a rug from command and planning and their "troops." If we find that they do have a comm line from control television to press and will soon exceed their ability to control situations where they have run out of answers and their red hands have brought up a control press.</p>

<p>We've exceeded their ability if the pressure is kept up. Our pressure and people are refusing to go along with them.</p>

<p>The questions "Who's going to clean up the horrible Belsens they've made? Who's going to clean up this field of mess, that's the next step on the public tongue. As soon as the public agrees there is a mess, can soon be put. The answer of course is us.</p>

<p>According to Julian Paget in his book on counter-insurgency (another excellent book, <strong>Counter-Insurgency Campaigning</strong> Julian Paget, Faber & Faber Ltd, 24 Russell Sq, London) the battle will be won when that point in England they have 92% information. That is the turn point. As we hit them when public begins to bring you information just waiting to see who forecasts are worry start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data until you 92% information. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data. Until then you are just waiting to see who forecasts are worrying start giving you data.</p>

<p>Never fight on your own terrain. We are not to fight on the terrain of allies and always try to fight on enemy soil only try making it.Don't let them relax or regroup. Keep a rout going by continual attack using old and new angles.</p>

<p>When they begin to use our terms and phrases the action will be won.</p>
