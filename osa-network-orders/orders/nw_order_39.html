                        <p>In dealing with governments, one would usually go on the theory that the government has stupidly accepted a false information into its files and is riding or leaning on one because of it. This would be relatively sane interpretation.</p>

<p>However, one cannot rule out another possibility. The government could be wilfully manufacturing false reports in order to get rid of somebody.</p>

<p>Thus one can see that dealing with a DAing of each false report would wind up as perpetual motion as one is a superficial lie factory.</p>

<p>The insane are not sane.</p>

<p>modern governments covertly execute hidden destructive intentions. By all standards</p>

<p>Thus, somewhere at the bottom of the pile is some hidden intention.</p>

<p>In collecting government files and the various false reports in them, through the use of Freedom of Information Act, it is not enough to simply see they are false and DA them. This of course is a necessary action but is NOT the basic action.</p>

<p>One needs to construct a data bank of all documents and cross-index to get all documents in their possession—using one tie to find things that will detect the existence of unreweaved additional documents.</p>

<p>This is not the final use of the data bank.</p>

<p>As in any insane being, one is looking for the basic intention that prompts the false reports factory to operate.</p>

<p>Somewhere at the bottom of the mess there will be found a being and an intention.</p>

<p>As one is dealing with the insane it probably won’t be logical. It will be what it is.</p>

<p>Confrontation of a government agency and DAing cools them down and causes them to back down. This is an insane attribute—to fear disclosure and greatly value their rickety P.R. So nothing in this should inhibit doing that.</p>

<p>But the end of this trail will be a blockbuster of a hidden order or intention.</p>

<p>It will have come from an insane individual with insane plans, with an insane idea that we could end it.</p>

<p>This is not but a crude example: “they make people think my plans to get the whole country crushed might be detected.” But that would be too sane.</p>

<p>More like, “they are really able to handle drugs so we would have to fire all our veterinarians.”</p>

<p>Someone insane has been on this line.</p>

<p>It is what the data bank, made up of craziest documents.</p>

<p>This will be among the earliest dates and the documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, will eventually turn if we carry right on through. And, documented and publicized, will blow the whole thing up.</p>

<p>You have seen how far fetched the reports are how ineffective the effort really is.</p>

<p>Well, don’t overlook that the lies are—but wilfully false and prompted by some basic intent we have not yet unmasked—but which we will.</p>
