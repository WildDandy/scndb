                        <p><strong>SITUATION:</strong> Thomas Szasz, MD, has in his books written the starting truth about institutional psychiatry and the MD.<br>His attack line is two pronged:<br>A. Abolish (don't reform) INSTITUTIONAL PSYCHIATRY and its MENTAL HEALTH front group. (See pgs XXXIV & XXV and 25 of *The Manufacture of Madness*).<br>B. Drive the <strong>MEDICAL DOCTOR</strong> out of all connection with mental healing or illness. (See pg 25).<br>As the US situation is the AMA and all the other countries in the UK situation as the WFMIH and mental health group, and as mental health group, and Europe are mental health as is South Africa and Rhodesia (uncertain in ANZO but certainly Psychiatric and British Psychological Assn.) Szasz's targets are those who have been striking at us.<br>Thus we must popularize Szasz and get him around.<br>Why: A powerful authoritative source speaking convincingly against these groups can greatly damage them if publicized. He is not publicized.<br><strong>MAJOR PURPOSE:</strong> To abolish institutional psychiatry and debar MDs from handling mental illness.<br><strong>MAJOR TARGET:</strong> To popularize Szasz internationally.<br><strong>PRIMARY:</strong><br>1. Set up under autonomous status a small PR unit (PR Officer, Legal Secretary, Reception, Typist) called "The International Human Rights Commission."<br>A. Furnish with an appropriate mail address and office where interviews can occur. Incorporate in Delaware and qualify in UK.<br>B. Cram the staff on *Effective PR*, the PR Series and the Target Series. Use word clearing.<br>C. Have them read Szasz's books, particularly *The Manufacture of Madness* with WC M2.<br>D. Have them work on this exact program, authorized by the Church of Scientology, from exact campaigns and major target only.<br>E. Have letterheads printed.<br><strong>VITAL TARGETS:</strong><br>A. To do nothing that is not effective.<br>B. To do nothing outside the scope of this program.<br>C. To do everything to popularize Szasz.<br>D. To be very busy and effective in executing programs.<br><strong>OPERATING TARGETS:</strong><br>1. Contact Dr. Szasz and inform him of the various Human Rights Commissions and that LRH is very impressed with his book and that a London Central Human Rights office is being set up and wants to recommend his books to politicians and heads of state and get his cooperation without opposition to use of his books. With this mild cooperation, libraries. Do what you can to secure the doctor's mild cooperation. He might occasionally arrange a TV show or interview for him. He is not to be told that the campaign is so heavily centered on him as he might feel it beyond his strength and we do not intend to tax him or involve him in any big disputes. Get a letter okaying the International HR Comm to publicize his books without cost to him.<br>B. Contact all publishers of Szasz's works (Harper and Row, publishers, N.Y., Evanston and London) on *Manufacture of Madness* and tell them you wish distributor discounts on all his books. This is in order to procure copies to present to reviewers, libraries and statesmen.<br>C. Collect names for an advisory board from human rights people and friendly psychiatrists who are hostile. Use "The Church of Scientology recommended you to us." unless a survey results in a better answer.<br>D. Reprint letterhead with advisory board.<br>E. Collect from all human rights activities of Church their horror stories and successes.<br>F. Do a pamphlet of them, under the calm headings and layouts, "The Work of the Atrocity Commissions." "Psychiatry Must Go." Collect a file of branch stories from many newspaper morgues.<br>G. Collect a file of branch stories from many newspaper morgues.<br>H. Publish a photolithographed collection under *INSTITUTIONAL PSYCHIATRY AT WORK*.<br>I. Get a list of branch chapters of NATS over the world. Spot the donation copy.<br>J. Send a copy of one of Szasz's books to the public library as a donation copy.<br>K. Collect a list of NATS newspaper contacts. Send each one a copy of Szasz's book "for review" with no letterhead.<br>L. Send a Szasz book to each Member of Parliament in UK and each US Senator with any reviews and a letter stating "This book is moving into the 10 million copy range. It serves as a note of change in public sentiment regarding the unpopularity of institutional psychiatry."<br>M. Send a copy (not a letter) of *The Manufacture of Madness* to each NATS chapter with "from ICHR," or growing hysteria of antagonism to institutional psychiatry is resulting in an aroused public as represented by this book."<br>N. Work out some attacks news stunts to get the ICHR attacked violently with the attackers fully identifiable.<br>O. Arrange any TV meeting possible with or without Szasz.<br>P. Run a campaign "Why 20 years?" backing up the persons saying work them hard.<br>Q. Execute them.<br>R. Work out a project to look up witchcraft laws and demand they be considered apply to institutional psychiatry. TV interviews. Sponsored legislation.<br>S. Reveal the plot by institutional psychiatry to kill all "incompetents" in Rhodesia, meaning the blacks. Use the proposal the anti-Scientology psychiatry there sent to Smith.<br>T. Connect institutional psychiatry to Germany in a revealing TV interview.<br>U. Demand all killed mental patients be given a proper Christian burial, especially in S.A.<br>V. Enfranchise chapters of ICHR "to protect people of the community from psychiatric witch hunts."<br>W. Collect NATS false stats and expose and publicize that institutional psychiatry says people are insane just to increase appropriations and that they are assisted and paid by members.<br>X. Find ways of warning doctors to disassociate from "mental healing quickly before they lose their professional repute in the public eye and furnish them with copies of the mental hospital atrocity stories. "Don't lend psychiatry your MD name - unload quick." One way is to have doctor members call on them and show them. (?) The average chapter does not know his profession caused it all in the first place.<br>Y. Continue to push and get reviewed Szasz's books.<br>Z. Add famous names to your advisory council as they are picked up.<br>AA. Preach "this is the public opinion revolt against institutions."<br>AB. Arrange a debate wherever possible making psychiatric supporters defend their tenets.<br>AC. Consult Szasz for any ideas he has to help free the poor.<br>AD. Organize funds drives (like NATS) to push his books who have been seized and put away just because they are old and poor. The exact reverse of NAIS fund raising put the exact pattern.<br>AE. Reveal a fully documented plot by institutional psychiatry to seize certain notables and writers.</p>
