                        <p>PR is a booby-trapped subject. You are at risk because the subject itself is insufficiently understood and the final action of PR in this society will be a total unmock of the nation. Nations are coming to pieces because the minute because they are using PR.</p>

<p>Some ideological mad hats come in and say, "Big business, they're just in business to make money." Actually, I don't think anybody is in business just to make money unless he is crazy. Money is an adjunct to the making of business. Hardly anybody would even be in ceramics making teacups if he was not very interested in producing teacups. Maybe down on the Ford assembly line they don't like their jobs too much but, at the same time, if they didn't have anything like that to do, they would be miserable.</p>

<p>So, somebody comes in and says "They are just in business to make money," which is a lie, and the response of the Ford Motor Company is not to make intelligence, but to find out who is trying to upset the Ford Motor Company community projects or somebody sending the Ford Motor Company and they go out into a fantastic barrage to make goodwill for somebody in instead, they go out put it is General Motors goodwill PK actions—and that is not real.</p>

<p>They put out this unreal, "We are a good organization because we support the community chest." Well, it is not what they are there for. They being attacked from this other corner with "They are just in business to make money." This is just an agitator and he is telling lies. So, you have this lie that the Ford Motor Company is okay because it supports the community chest and 14 hours of every week's clubs and that is why upper executive's week is devoted to giving lectures at the Boys' Clubs and that is why Ford is a good company. And you get this mad hate with whiskers and bombs coming in saying, "The Ford Motor Company is only interested in making money and if we just had a social, super-communist idiotical state, we would be all set and what we want to do is and the best thing for the nation, is to smash the Ford Motor Company."</p>

<p>Nobody is handling this PR false report and saying, "Why don't you guys go home?" Nobody is tracking down the source of the agitation and, between those two fallacies, neither one of which they meet, they create consistent problems. They give an expectancy on the part of the public that the Ford Motor Company, through the Ford Foundation and other areas, chases butterflies. Professor Umphisha, which a lot of balderdash gets $325,000 to go and be entertained, so you get a false riddle or Noodlepate T, these are unrealities, being entered in dies Upper Slobovia. What will follow with a false C and the final result is a personal degrade and that is the penalty of PR.</p>

<p>The basic aberration on the track is denial of self—and PR can walk you right straight into the denial of self.</p>

<p>You turn people loose out there who are not well grounded on their R or how R relates to PR and you start slamming into the society with PR technology and you are going to be in trouble.</p>

<p>PR has come down to a sort of a cover, nattery, gossipy old woman.</p>

<p>Until they are a sort of how to get rid of the competition. PR has slid right on down scale until they are a to how to cover of the competition.</p>

<p>The first PR guy was PT. Barnum and his sort of approach: "Forty lions and the biggest elephant in the world, ladies and gentleman," and great, big billboards. It was sufficiently phony that it started backing off from blatant press agentry into a name "press agentry," but it actually a reaction from press agentry. It even has the covert sophisticate, but it is now has gone down! It is being made more and more attack. And the final end result of this will destroy the whole country. It is unreal. It leads people to an unreal expectancy.</p>

<p>Big business is not necessarily good, sweet, with a halo around its head, but it isn't necessarily a bunch of ravening dogs. Big business under this attack just moves sideways into PR and has actually moved itself now around the news media, and you have a country being run by a group of PR guys who sit in back of and own the news media. It is throwing everything out of gear. If they don't like somebody, they turn loose what they laughingly call "PR and it is more and more lies. It has gone from the lies of press agentry, "the greatest elephant in the world," down to the biggest bum in the world.</p>

<p>So, therefore; if we grab hold of PR without preparing it and without seeing its pitfalls and without growing it in, we might very well be in trouble. It is alright at this stage of the game to push it just called PR, but people in Scientology think PR means ARC. They have got this thing totally identified and it is not, not true PR and PR is not A-R-C; it is A-C. Just try to run on A-C with no R in it. It is death and dynamite.</p>

<p>Because we know more about mental technology than the PR guys, we can take a degraded technology which is very well worked out and empirically very worthwhile. They have got a lot of data in it.</p>

<p>We must prepare and educate people in this subject. It is a great subject, but it is something like using penicillin. They don't quite know what it is and penicillin wears out. In another decade penicillin won't do anything but kill people—it will have worn out by that time.</p>
