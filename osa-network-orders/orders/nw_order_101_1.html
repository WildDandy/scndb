                        <p>Referencer:<br>HCO PL 5 Oct 71<br>PR Series 12<br>PROPAGANDA BY<br>REDEFINITION OF WORDS<br>I made an observation that the Supreme Court decision of a child being able to sue his parents for deprogramming was not well publicized.<br>The Los Angeles Times took more than a week to publish an article on this decision. It took them that long, of course, to have conferences with the psychologists and psychiatrists and the National Association of Mental Health and other bosses to decide what the new party line would be against religion.<br>They finally found two sociologists they could quote.<br>The Times is vividly on the side of:<br>a) drug addiction,<br>b) crime,<br>c) kidnapping,<br>d) beating,<br>e) rape and,<br>f) civil commotion.<br>Note that, in their hands, "deprogramming" becomes "questioning," when by the deprogrammer's own literature it is done with "physical mayhem." Note also that this is a black propaganda piece stigmatizing religion as "brainwashing," whereas the real definition and procedure of brainwashing is exactly that used by the deprogrammers.<br>That can play this game: But this propaganda burden here is to switch words. Two of the words is not news. The Times is standard black PR. One redefines the meaning of the word "brainwashing." This could be accused of brainwashing its readers. Possibly a campaign label such "press wonders cure of people would read brainwash the public," and repeated statements and teachings that their efforts to brainwash the public to grant of L.A., etc., etc., might cure of government attempted propaganda stunts. By using crime and violence as their specialty they are seeking to switch. They want the public to think crime is okay and probably engage in other brainwash the public with lies and distortions. They favor IRS, FBI, psychologists and psychiatrists in general are pushing a propaganda line that is a brainwash of actual conditions in the world.<br>In the Signal Hill murder of Settles—who was found a "suicide" in jail—they apparently dug up a psychiatrist to do blood tests to prove the athlete was on drugs. But a psychiatrist is not an authority on blood tests and had nothing to do with the case. The judge in the case left the question open as to whether it was murder by the Signal Hill police or suicide, but the Times decided the matter.<br>Brainwashing is forcing lies on people—or could be defined that way too. So the Times is using PR channels and continues to put the connection together.<br>If one attempts to brainwash the people of LA quite obviously together, newspapers and brainwashing—they would get very sick of the word very quick.<br>when one speaks of the Times—such as always using brainwashing as an adjective.<br>This "brainwashing" is one current propaganda trick that has been agreed upon by the anti-religious nuts. So the shrewd smash up their carefully worked out strategy by turning the word on them. And it is true that the Times is a brainwashing tool used by the establishment to cow the population.<br>Nothing, in the first letter on this subject is changed by the appearance of this article. One has, now, what the psych party line is.<br>The real details of deprogramming would sound pretty juicy in the courtroom.</p>
