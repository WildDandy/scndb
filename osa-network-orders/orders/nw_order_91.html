                        <p>I am always perfectly willing to imitate any enemy successful action. I happen to be not so much self-determined as pan-determined.</p>

<p>They do something very successful; they walk around and get their board, the “very best people,” and they ask Senator Gluta if he won’t serve on the Mayor. They collect all of these names and they put something to all the letterhead to the people who see the letterhead think it is all something that is actually there that makes him, chartywise, look like a saint. They have all these names on the guy that is the World Federation of Mental Health and the National Health Association. Then they get their own proffics—they have little chapters—and they go around and collect money. It’s just pure psycho.</p>

<p>There’s murder and death back of this. So the collection of names isn’t all that difficult if you have some puff to sell.</p>

<p>The name has got to have puff, too. Well, you see there’s a very important organization, you see, very important, only the very best people possibly have anything to do with it and considerable, of course, administrative matters or new and that sort of thing—to give you advice on asked—nonprofit, of course, and all we forming state. And we thought we have been once at a man of your brilliance, and we would like to make it for a member of the Advisory Council.</p>

<p>“Oh well, yes of course, Oh, rather you hum hum.” And the next thing, you start working up some puff you in the press and issue puff releases in the press. “The Advisory Board of the American Institute of Human engineering was addressed yesterday at the luncheon by Senator Puff Pants and he said in his great wisdom that poor people were terribly poor. Yes, a paper was submitted on it.”</p>

<p>You get one name and you can get two, and you get two and you can get six and so forth. You are not looking for donations when you are looking for those names; you are just looking for your Advisory Council. Now you take that battery of names and then you go around and ask for donations. That’s how it’s done.</p>
