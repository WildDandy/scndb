                        <p>References:<br>HCO PL 30 Oct 63<br>HCO PL Sept 69R<br>rev. & reiss. 24.9.83<br>HCO PL 12 Oct. 62.</p>

<p>Counter-intelligence, in a limited meaning of the term, means "prevention from being infiltrated or operating to the enemy." In a broader sense it means turning enemy agents and losing turned agents.</p>

<p>Security, in an industrial sense, is just some 78-year-old watchman in a uniform checking the gate and building. In a counter-intelligence sense security means something entirely different going into something much wider. One can have watchmen as part of, or directly check at least windows and locks.</p>

<p>From there security goes to counter-intelligence. Making certain of no escapement of information via waste baskets, phone taps, infiltration of associated channels. One can even go so far as to put an agent in an enemy sector to find out if any information has escaped.</p>

<p>Destruction of files no longer needed, recovery of files sent out, policing of the security mindedness of staff, checking their mail security, all come under the heading of security.</p>

<p>I don't know now if there are local Security Officers or if they have the hat of doing all the above. Or if the materials have been assembled to hat them. I have some books on the subject, none of them very embracive, mainly dealing with industrial espionage.</p>

<p>The potential security breach of files and staff brings up the need for a highly hatted Security Officer and security guards.</p>

<p>The SO does have some security people who are more or less trained as guards but none to the degree of Security Officer in charge of an area who could skillfully conduct the actions necessary to bring about excellent or nearly impenetrable security. They could however be trained.</p>

<p>The main risk, today, of ANY office or industrial operation, much less an intelligence force, is being penetrated. Thus it is pretty vital that a tariff exists to prevent it—as a full breach.</p>

<p>When a breach of security is found to have occurred in an area where confidential information is kept, it means that there has been a potential outflow of information to the enemy. In such a situation it is intelligent intelligence-wise to assume that such information DID leak.</p>

<p>In that event, the steps to alert and handle the situation to any information coming on THEIR lines that show there is a leak somewhere, to look over the most serious data that could have been leaked any other lines you have that might arise.</p>

<p>The handling of potential outflow of information should include the prevention of future leaks. You should be alert to find such potential leaks, before they aggressively find you.</p>
