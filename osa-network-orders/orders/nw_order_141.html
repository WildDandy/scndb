                        <p>PRESS RELEASE, 28 JANUARY 1969</p>

<p>The psychiatrist has a new definition for insanity which destroys all civil and human rights. In the World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 98, Legislation Affecting Psychiatric Treatment, on page 24, an insane person is cunningly defined as one whose capacity for social autonomy is inadequate as well as those who show themselves to be a danger to law and order.</p>

<p>This booklet also seeks to reduce churches. It also recommends a bypass of judicial procedures. Thus anyone who disagrees with the society or psychiatry can be whisked away, imprisoned, injured and condemned to death.</p>

<p>Psychiatry arrogantly makes nothing of legal and human rights and has developed a Hitler one-way road of taking care of their enemies and controlling governments.</p>

<p>Psychiatry shows itself plainly to be a political activity, not a healing science, since never ever get well.</p>

<p>Dr. T P Rees of England, who is a founder of this organization instigating attacks and inquiries about Scientology, helped write the booklet. It is a smooth, fast subversion of all human rights. If anyone disagrees, they say he is insane. If he is insane, he has no rights. If he has no rights, he can be imprisoned, injured or killed.</p>

<p>OSA Network Order No. 141</p>

<p>Who are these men above the law?<br>1984, here we come.</p>

<p>PRESS RELEASE, 29 JANUARY 1969</p>

<p>Instead of attacking churches and independent research, governments should form a sanity commission to inquire into the abuses and invasion of human rights by psychiatry. England has no constitution or laws that protect citizens or secure equal rights under law.</p>

<p>In Scientology our real problem is a constant parade of injured and damaged people coming to us, who have been brutalized by psychiatrists. Girls who have been raped by them—even boys. Brain injuries from savage, careless shocks. Listless, apathetic, hurt people. Men who have been castrated like the Germans did in death camps.</p>

<p>My own petition and public lines contain several letters a day, pleading for help after psychiatric damage.</p>

<p>For psychiatric organizations to criticize Scientology is the most fantastic hypocrisy on earth. These men are not healers. They are trained killers. For in all the society they have never found anyone who disagrees with them. Not one.</p>

<p>If we call, as they do, anyone cured by psychiatry, insane, then those who agree with this human butchery should wear a swastika arm band so we can recognize them.</p>
