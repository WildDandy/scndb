                        <p>It has long been found that an insane person or agency will also sign self-destructive releases and contracts.</p>

<p>In confrontations with government agencies, part of the <strong>PREPARATION</strong> for any conference where the object is to make them be good is to prepare a <strong>DOCUMENT</strong> which is believed most extensive surrender one can dream up.</p>

<p>At first you may not state such persons or agencies would sign what would be a total surrender or something as self-destructive or legally valuable as you could possibly wish. You will be amazed.</p>

<p><strong>NEVER</strong> go into a confrontation where you want something without the full document written up ready for signature.</p>

<p>It does not have to be on their stationery. It can be a legal looking foolscap you can hand it in blue cover with a red ribbon. It must be so composed as to carry legal weight. And a copy must be to hand.</p>

<p>You carry your copy and then tell them to sign. Override any argument that they need higher authority or time. <strong>Never delay</strong>.</p>

<p>Example: Going to confront the Better Mothers Bureau that has been putting lies out about you. Make a document that says they have falsified the reports, that they undertake never to do so again and promise a $10,000 bond not to. Have your confrontation with someone in authority, DA him, scare him, get him to sign.</p>

<p><strong>SECOND ACTION</strong></p>

<p>If further persuasion is needed also have prepared and in your attache case, not produced unless further argument is needed, a quitclaim signed by the directors promising not to sue for past crimes and giving them a quitclaim in exchange for the undertaking—with the proviso of course no other such actions on their part turn up after this date.</p>

<p>If they refuse to sign, then you push the quitclaim which adds more threat and they feel they have an exchange.</p>

<p>If the plea is “insufficient authority,” you then infer it’s too bad as the person you’re talking to will be blamed for refusing to cooperate when the suit if filed = job threat.</p>

<p>Remember, the insane self-destruct.</p>

<p>Give them every opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>AND NEVER ACCEPT A VERBAL UNDERTAKING TO BE GOOD.</strong> It isn’t worth the air used.</p>

<p>Such documents are the only acceptable evidence an agency has been handled.</p>

<p>And such documents <strong>must</strong> also self-confess so they <strong>CAN</strong> be used for suit!</p>

<p>The motto is “Permit the enemy to destroy himself.” He will.</p>
