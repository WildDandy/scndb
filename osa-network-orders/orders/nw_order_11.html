<p>There was and probably still is an international conspiracy to attack, black PR and crush Dianetics and Scientology.</p>

<p>The GO never really got to the bottom of this conspiracy despite the fact that the same stories and the same pattern of black PR emerged simultaneously internationally. We know that the GO itself was turned and so we cannot guarantee that their search was either honest or well directed.</p>

<p>SOURCE OF ATTACKS</p>

<p>For a long time I have looked for a source of these attacks the Church has been experiencing.</p>

<p>There are numerous indicators that psychologists (who are under the thumb of psychiatrists) have mounted attacks on Dianetics and Scientology and their organizations.</p>

<p>The J. Edgar Hoover attack of the mid-50s and onward was, I think, instigated by the American Medical Association and the AMA acts as a sort of parent to</p>

<p>psychiatrists and psychologists. It goes this way: The psychologists, to practice, have to be under the wing and supervision of psychiatrists. Psychiatrists, to practice, have to remain medical doctors and under the wing of the American Medical Association.</p>

<p>There are innumerable interlocking organizations, all adding up to the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and possibly the American Psychological Association, which interlock in organizations directed by the Rockefellers. I looked into this in New York in 1973 and was absolutely astonished at the number of organizations and associations grouped in that fundtion. Although they deny it, the Rockefellers also own a heavy share of the American drug industry which interlocks with the American Medical Association and at one time the FDA lobby in Washington interlinked with the Food and Drug Administration in those FDA attacks on the E-Meter.</p>

<p>The original Commonwealth attack was from the British Psychological Association in Australia. The first attack on Dianetics was engineered by the Psychology Department of the George Washington University in 1950.</p>

<p>NATURE OF ATTACKERS</p>

<p>Now please take the following very seriously: In all of the years from 1950 onward that I was handling the criminality investigating, I never failed once to establish beyond any doubt with me in investigative backgrounds of any attacker. It became a very stable datum as Executive and director. I never in immediately look for their criminal backgrounds. At one time, in 1954/55, there were about 21 persons who were attacking the Church and almost casually I ran the backgrounds of these down and found that 18 of them had flagrant criminal backgrounds—and by criminal I mean criminal in the eyes of the courts or law. The last three were never investigated. In South Africa a primary attacker was found to be an illegal diamond buyer. So outstanding I got tired of the investigation. The reason why there remained the criminal background of attackers is well established.</p>

<p>You would undoubtedly find that the more serious litigants against the Church have criminal backgrounds of their own.</p>

<p>Criminals can be directly influenced by psychologists and psychiatrists both by blackmail and implanting (which goes on all the time today) and are easily used as pawns or patsies in instigating attacks.</p>

<p>INVESTIGATION</p>

<p>It would be of great benefit to actually run down the core of these international attacks.</p>

<p>It might be wise to turn private investigators loose along the lines as given above with this type of approach:</p>

<p>a) to run back all the connections of key attackers,<br>b) to run down their pasts for sure and for real to see how these<br>interlock with any possible international conspiracy to suppress<br>Dianetics and Scientology.</p>

<p>You may zero-in on such a conspiracy and get to the actual instigators of the attacks. At the very least it would give you leads which would be invaluable.</p>

<p>Such an investigation might seem to be costly but I would think it would be very costly not to do it.</p>
