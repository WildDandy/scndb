                        <p>A government is actually that gradient of reaching the people through its social business groups. Any government that endures is actually a government of groups, not a government of individuals—they can't govern individuals. When they start governing individuals they try to give everything away to the individual to keep them quiet. That's dole and more public funds have to be given. That's why they have to give such heavy sympathy, the "best people".</p>

<p>These governments are fascist in nature. They have all the attributes of fascism: "Racial purity", "The best race". Have to execute people to get them out of the road." The keynote of fascism is that all this has to be fought with force. It is some kind of monodochial thing going on in ideas society and that is what brings it about. Every group through which a government would normally govern is being knocked to pieces. Because the government itself has gone to wild-eyed fanaticism on some kind of a monodochial basis.</p>

<p>A communist government, for instance, is all for group gets and anybody that isn't a communist or any group that isn't a communist communism short shift. They are trying to make an allness of it.</p>

<p>If ever we would try to get rid of everybody who was not a Scientologist, we could make exceed to to any point of control, the most serious mistake west.</p>

<p>The communist tries to get rid of everybody who isn't a communist.</p>

<p>These guys have got some new weird philosophy which is probably socialism. It includes atheism but it is socialism by the "best people". It what is "best" for the people—over their dead bodies, what is "best" for them: a planned society.</p>

<p>I don't think there is an intellect anywhere in the universe sufficiently adequate to account for every detail that would go to make up the intricate lives of individuals on a day-to-day basis. And that is what these utopias try to do. Nobody could do it. After they get it all planned up they find out they haven't allowed for any streetcar conductors. There are always goofys.</p>

<p>They are trying to figure out these "super leaves and seeds". An ant society might be figured out there only have to move leaves and seeds and dig burrows and assign people positions in lines of march—a relatively simple society. A society that is industrialized, agrarian, fringe area hunting, fishing, arts, entertainment…no, it can't be done. A utopia could never be planned. And that is all that is wrong with a utopia.</p>
