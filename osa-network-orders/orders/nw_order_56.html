                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>The United Nations got themselves in trouble. Alger Hiss, the famous communist wrote the background of the World Health Organization (WHO). It was a communist group used for communist infiltration up to the time when the <br>CIA made so much smoke that they got rid of Brock Chisholm as the head of WHO. He was a card-carrying communist. Chisholm simply moved over to pretended it was still a communist oriented World Federation of Mental Health, but it already was part of the United Nations, used his communication lines and his built already existing espionage network into the West. And that is the little bit history of all of this.</p>

<p>The president of the National Mental Health Association of California is Earl Warren Jr., of course—they have just collected these “best people.” The names, the names, the names as he used paint, Earl Warren jr.,</p>

<p>There’s a blackmail and these nasty people. They get their wives and daughters under that about intelligence operation. Every time—which probably have—because a frality is an have “best things” on them we can traced up some wife or daughter. He is under care. His daughter illegitimate secretary, such as Lord Bainiel, the first man to attack us, we have discovered a death certificate and under psychiatric care. That was married in Switzerland but the birth and his wife is the marriage certificate are reversed on the data. And he is the “best people.” He is the last of the great Crawfords who were on Earls of Lanark. There’s nothing worse than a decadent democracy or a societate world that has gone to pieces and isn’t there any more. They were valid in 1890.</p>

<p>These people have a terrible frailty. It’s not that I sneer at them, I sneer at their pretense. At the slightest smell of their ceasing to be “best people”—Bertie appears at the dinner party with a slight stain on his tuxedo, or he fails to propose to the local Bar Harbor dowager, or refuses to propose to Mary Ann which is the correct marriage—that’s the end of Bertie! He is now cut dead. Somebody gets you hiccups at a dinner party and he practically finished. They are the least tolerant people you ever heard of. So the second there is an odor exuding out of National Mental Health Foundations, “Oh, I’ve never heard of them, you know.”</p>

<p>The National Association of Mental Health in England has the Archbishop of Canterbury and two directors of the Bank of England on their board. Boy, they really collect them. As soon as those guys get the slight odor, they won’t know them. Their resignations will drop in line.</p>

<p>There is a mental action. A person who is trying to stop something is very easily stopped. He’s got the overt of illegally keeping something from which he has a withhold, but he is not admitting that he’s stopping. So you’ve just sort of point a finger at him and he will stop. He will only stop as long as he’s hidden. The second he comes to view it like an engram; an engram in view is not very damaging.</p>
