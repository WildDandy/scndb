                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>I have to wear the Washington legal hats and go up there and solve various difficulties for them.</p>

<p>It’s a spectacle of people defending, defending. You know, you can defend yourself for about five years, to attack anybody. To them, on this one suit that has been going for more holes and it has never occurred that would be very dangerous!<br>Don’t attack anybody.</p>

<p>Look at the situation. Every time the enemy has an attack, you defend against it and that is all you do. Any castle, to hold out, got offers to sortie. The proper strategy for any battle is to find a weak point in the enemy lines and attack it.</p>

<p>The reason the United States is losing against communism is simply on these same mathematics. That they are losing is patent. All they are doing is defending, the points attacked.</p>

<p>On the Berlin thing, before it really came up to a hot boil, the United States was not claiming proper action to go and find something to collect a piece. Yet there for anything this piece over there is and it is never going to be able to swap Berlin they stand, defending, defending, defending, defending. Well, and they want to win?</p>

<p>How about an auditor that sits there and defends and defends and defends and defends and defends against the attack of a pc? He never looks for the bypassed charge and he never does anything effective to straighten out the case. He just sits there and defends himself. He would last about two minutes. This is about the most dangerous thing you can do. Look it over. It is the most unhethan thing you can do.</p>

<p>You can defend to a certain degree and you will always win to a certain degree. But use 75 percent of your energies to attack and you don’t have to defend. Find a weak spot and attack it. Attack expertly and attack perfectly and to win with the attack. Always put your concentration on the attack and you win every time.</p>

<p>People look awful silly two miles in your rear without any supplies, without any ammunition, with no defenses and no place to go. They attacked all right. The whole front of the battle shifted. They attacked and you have this sort of thing happen and destroyed their supply dump. It is very embarrassing to have this defend. You went.</p>

<p>The whole life is an interchange, if you are going to live. It is an interchange activity. It is putting out anchor points.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the gradient scale of how you would go about this.</p>

<p>Supposing you are just there all by yourself and there is no limitation to your putting out anchor points. You can put out as many anchor points as you like.</p>

<p>Somebody else shows up and says, “You shouldn’t put out these anchor points,” or “I want to have some of this space too,” and they put out anchor points against your anchor points. So you don’t put out anchor points quite so far. I am talking about the factors now.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose that every time you put out an anchor point, somebody else forbade you to put out that anchor point and you complied and agreed that is about now your anchor point. How big do you think you would get after a while? Didn’t put out big you are now. That is practically the way you got there.</p>

<p>There is apathy as just continuing to put out your anchor points. This is to throw anybody into anything quite disturbing and there is nothing quite so certain to most disturbing activity that you can engage in. Everybody says, “you mustn’t put out your anchor points,” and you put out your anchor points. Then they put out lots of reasons why you shouldn’t put out your anchor points and you put out anchor points. They bring all sorts of duress to bear on you why you should not put out your anchor points and you put out your anchor points. What is going to happen to their morale?</p>

<p>Sometimes it is very difficult to continue to put out anchor points in this particular way. Sometimes you just get cut to ribbons and it is those particular times that you got cut to ribbons you tend to remember as lesson not to attack or lessons not to put out anchor points.</p>

<p>The gradient scale on the thing goes: Putting out anchor points, in other words, continuing to create your space; then attacking which is preventing you from putting out your space. That is also putting out anchor points. And you get along along human levels and what are you to involved with you are involved with attacking those you are preventing you from putting out anchor points.</p>

<p>You go down scale just a little bit further and you start defending yourself against socially acceptable characteristics; all sorts of things. These things, to have defenses against. This causes “to live good,” “to have good behavior,” are basically defenses against attacks, direct attacks.</p>

<p>You can go downscale even further than that. You have the defenses against possible attacks and this causes people to live in castles, dig moats that nobody will ever think of ever charging against, invent weapons that have no particular use and invent social characteristics that are impossible to attack. This causes you, in other words, to go downscale a bit further.</p>

<p>There is a point further downscale than that, which is imagining that you are under attack. You are defending yourself against possible attacks. You are not being attacked—you are simply preparing yourself to defend possible attacks.</p>

<p>Just below that, there is a point, where, because there are all these defenses, there therefore must be attacks. It proves itself. You have got a mere dug are all the way around the place. Obviously there must be somebody going to ride across that moat.</p>

<p>Some of the screens that a thetan puts up are terribly entrancing. These screens are in the first place, they put them up against a lion. The lion might still be there. You are very entrancing because they leave them up forever. Why did they put them up would, first have to take the screen down to find out. You don’t dare take the screen down because you would be attacked. You can get a thetan there.</p>

<p>This causes a very funny action if the lion were still, a pc, and get him to find one of these black screens and get him to pick up one little corner of it and peek around it real fast. Sometimes he will really have to get his nerve up to do it—and he will. He will see something like a mocked-up lion or a snake or something on the other side of the black screen. One of his answers or confronting is cover it up so he won’t have to confront it—black it out. There is the final mechanism of a defense.</p>

<p>Permanent defenses lead to a belief that one is under attack. When you get way down scale it must be that you are under attack because there are the defenses. Somebody must be ready to launch the rockets at any moment because there are all these radars waiting to detect them and he never gets out to look because here he becomes mobile. So therefore, actually, of course, the more defenses, the arless attackers. And I imagine there are nations on planets, someplace in that galaxy at this very moment, who have no neighbors, but who believe that a life of complete defense, are there with full armies, ready to attack them and live implicitly in those neighbors complete immobility, never going abroad, carrying through all of the various survival activities to prevent an attack against nations which are no longer there and that are long since gone to dust.</p>

<p>One has a defense up against an area of confusion. He has ceased to datum, all arranged to take care of an area of confusion that has long since a stable exist.<br>A thetan eventually traps himself.</p>

<p>What do you think are the chances of your opponents of trillions one hundred; trillions written there hundred times—still being alive and kicking and ready to knock your block off? And yet, you have all the defenses against that period all rigged and all the stable data ready one hundred those defenses against those confusions and attackers of trillions one hundred.</p>

<p>And that, in actual fact, is what a thetan is doing.</p>

<p>The above are mechanisms of defense of a certain kind of order. They are also, of course, mechanisms of attack.</p>

<p>You will have to defend to a certain degree. But if you use 75% of your energies to attack, you will always win.</p>
