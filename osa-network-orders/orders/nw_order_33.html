                        <p>The US culture is under such heavy, heavy attack. It is a deteriorated culture and it has deteriorated with such speed that we did not have the organizational problems in 1962 that we had in 1966. The president of the United States (Kennedy) came into power on the money that was made in liquor and prostitution. That was the kind of president this was and it was during his presidency that all of this took place and it has taken place at such speed which normally helps stable for a century.</p>

<p>A whole culture changed which has lots of remain from way up high at a crack. Not even prohibition could crack that. That would happen—changed it, deteriorated it a bit, but the back of American culture—to the reign of one president tells us that it sources that the back of this could look during the control of society anything in a deteriorated culture is go anywhere. So the wrong ways to handle are missing, or wanting, or themselves criminal near the "authorities".</p>

<p>If the culture in the top has deteriorated and, if it has deteriorated at speed, it must have been done from the top.</p>

<p>If you were doing a survey as to how to put the culture back together again, the first place you would look would be the head of the Narcotics Bureau to see if he was also a member of the Mafia.</p>

<p>The national situation, culturally, is deteriorating and it will either resurge along strong-arm fascist lines and recover, or it will disintegrate and pass eventually into the hands of the enemy. During the period of its disintegration, you have to continue to operate.</p>

<p>I take a very pessimistic view based on one thing: Health, Education and Welfare has ably assisted in pushing it down, not only in suppressing scientific developments. Let's look at it factually, cultural propaganda-wise; They have depressed a scientific development. They have had the education of American youth in their hands now the whole last generation. A survey showed that 73% of the Gendels were in the service did not agree with the preamble of the Declaration of Independence. They didn't know what it was and thought it was some revolutionary camp that they wanted nothing to do with.</p>

<p>People have been taught the Constitution is old and really isn't any more and that communism is okay—it's merely safeguard wrong. That what H.E.W. has taught America. Therefore there is no basic practiced of liberty installed in the new American population. They have not been trained in—they expect certain things, so they are at every hand dismayed about the situation—to gather up into revolutionary or protesting groups and you get a general disintegration.</p>

<p>You may not be aware of the degree and speed of deterioration that is on culture. In 1962, we never had any drug cases. All of a sudden, the whole country is on drugs. What a heroic operation. It should go down in history as one of the greatest political coups of all time; pulling the whole bottom out from underneath a culture.</p>

<p>We have had traces of how it was done: Guys appeared in the area of high schools with grips full of LSD and they gave them out to all the high schools on the basis that it was a program that were supposed to get a report on, but nobody ever came around and asked for the report.</p>

<p>These guys were psychologists and psychiatrists and they went into these areas and they just handed it out to all the little kiddies as they came out of school and they were supposed to put in a report and I suppose the principal was standing there, "Oh, yes, well psychiatry research; it has to be done, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>This was done with finance. It must have cost millions. Of course, it's a very profitable activity.</p>
