                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>What is called an "Intelligence Hypothesis" (working intelligence theory for a given situation) is of vital necessity in extending an org's reach and economizing on action and work while increasing effectiveness.</p>

<p>So far we have been using an "Intelligence Hypothesis" I developed in 1965. Taking all channels of attack on us (country by country), I found the cycle of attacking sources a) Income Tax b) Health Department or agency c) Immigration and d) a type of press.</p>

<p>Moving this up to an <strong>international</strong> level and trying to find out who could have that much influence, the Intelligence Hypothesis I formed was that it would have to be a member of the World Bank with psychiatric connections or who planned usages of psychiatry as part of world control.</p>

<p>We used this to narrow and target our searches. It led us to WFMH and the NAMH. And it served us well. But it did not lead all the way until this year.</p>

<p>We found the central handler (one who orders operatives and operations) and proved it by numerous correspondence we were given. The track on this was started by a bit of insight of the National Association on Mental Health in England. Mary Appleby, Secretary. And as has proved out absolutely. The person is "she" who writes and phones her contacts to start attacks on Scientology.</p>

<p>Her uncle (just now deceased) was OTTO NIEMEYER of the World Bank.</p>

<p>So that finally ends off the 1965 Intelligence Hypothesis as totally correct. It has gotten us this far.</p>

<p>But in getting there, new data has shown up.</p>

<p>Brilliant work in tracing the origins of the WFMH disclosed it and the NAMH to have NAZI origins. Goering's cousin, Villinger, others others were at the root of Nazism in Germany and brought Hitler to power! They started the death camps and they, not Hitler, ordered the extermination of Jews.</p>

<p>Racial purity, genes, man is an animal, etc., were originated (and still held to) by this psychiatric group.</p>

<p>In 1936 they dominated the Beers organization (NAMH).</p>

<p>In 1948, feeling before war was coming, these people formed the WFMH in London.</p>

<p>We were fooled into thinking criminal communistic because they also penetrated Russia. Pavlov was one of them! (Trained at the University of Leipzig).</p>

<p>We thought it went Russia to West. Actually that is because it went Nazi to Russia and Nazi to West. Both Russia and the West are thoroughly dominated in the field of psychiatry by the original Nazis. So it could look as though it were coming in from Russia.</p>

<p>The third party between East and West could be the neo-Nazi!</p>

<p>The Nazi had three principle channels into what we now know.</p>

<p>So we need a new working theory to extend the world.</p>

<p>Intelligence. Nazi intelligence was the largest and most effective intelligence organization the world ever knew. Many texts exist on this. After WW I they had their files, brought them up to date about 1928 and won Hitler countries after. They had agents by the thousands in every nation—Hitler brought those to power. Poland and France to fall by penetration at the top. Hitler won Austria, Czechoslovakia they had and won by Intelligence. His force of arms was a disruption to Intelligence take-overs (geopolitics).</p>

<p>2. Drugs. The Germans had domination of the world's drug industry. Their chemists and firms covered the globe. They even sought political extension by bargaining new drug cures.</p>

<p>3. Psychiatry and Psychology. Leipzig is the source of the animal and reflex theories now believed and taught all over the world. Nazi racial purity, gene theories, etc., are taken from German psychiatry and psychology. German psychiatrists gas chambered 300,000 insane/sick Hitler originated the orders about Jews, etc.—Hitler only okayed them. This kill-fire is now used in every country—gene theory, must sterilize and kill. Psychiatric techniques used in England and elsewhere are Nazi practices. The death camp atrocities now disclosed in Germany and elsewhere are psychiatric.</p>

<p>NEW WORKING HYPOTHESIS</p>

<p>Apparently there exists somewhere a Nazi Memorial or plan to conquer the world.</p>

<p>By intelligence infiltration of governments, drug addiction, a dependency and using Nazi police to eliminate political undesirables and minorities and group is bent on world political conquest.</p>

<p>When Nazi Germany was militarily defeated the intelligence operatives and files were left "in place." In other countries, the Nazi chemists were left in the seized drug firms abroad, the psychiatric "empire" still existed overseas.</p>

<p>At the defeat of Germany these three networks were not wiped out abroad but left there in place.</p>

<p>Many military officers in allied services were financially well connected—related to bankers or were bankers.</p>

<p>These intelligence, drug personnel and psychiatric network files passed into financial hands.</p>

<p>The German Mark rose as the only strong European currency after WW II. West Germany now has most of the world's gold or at least large hoards of it.</p>

<p>NEW INTELLIGENCE HYPOTHESIS</p>

<p>NAZISM WAS CONTINUED ON THREE NETWORKS AS A MEANS OF WORLD CONQUEST.</p>

<p>We see that no arrests psychiatry for murder, mayhem, fraudulent money collection are found to be done by intelligence type control of government figures. Key positions could only be occupied England by ex-intelligence men who worked in the German sector. If Appleby and almost every other political person who attacked us in our opponents have intelligence background (US, ANZCO, Spain, South Africa, etc.)—that (as did this) applies should be true in the other either in their own country or Germany. These political mouthpieces have ex- or current intelligence background. And as this is turning out—to a Fascist network, they have discoverable Fascist connections.</p>

<p>Psychiatric opponents are all part of the Nazi connected WFMH or NAMH. They are also, some of them, intelligence connected and many are German in name or origin. Their technology and what they urge is pure Fascism straight out of Nazi death camps.</p>

<p>Drug firms are ex-German or German connected. They finance or support the Nazi networks. They also are turning the West to drug addiction.</p>

<p>Finance networks exist to crush other currencies and elevate the German currency and look to the other three networks to politically pave the way.</p>

<p>Now this is theory. There is much data to support it. We can document the earlier working theory. Appleby is Nazi pure and simple. So is the WFMH and the NAMH as they all advocate in Nazi.</p>

<p>There is negative proof of political control by intelligence. Governments seem powerless to arrest or clean up mayhem, murder, theft, etc., conducted by psychiatry.</p>

<p>German psychology was taught at every university. Even Dewey the "great American Educator" was indoctrinated in Leipzig.</p>

<p>Nazi police and political tactics are beginning to show up in the West.</p>

<p>Actually the networks are very frail, very prone to exposure.</p>

<p>If this Intelligence Hypothesis is true, it is of great use to us. For instance—head of FDA attacks us is Action—run back his Fascist background and connections.</p>

<p>We should test out this theory.</p>

<p>The attacks on Scientology are directed by Appleby.</p>

<p>We are attacked because if we proved psychiatry false by introducing a true mental science we would destroy their political terror weapon.</p>

<p>There are then four networks in all, as we must include international banking. The four must be run from somewhere, possibly privately, not governmentally, from West Germany.</p>

<p>If this theory is true then every attacker has one or more of four connections, Intelligence, psychiatric, drug and banking.</p>

<p>To make even further headway on making a saner planet we should test out this new theory and see if it doesn't lead us to a new-origin point for world distress. We may even be looking at the real 3rd party of East-West tension that gives us the threat of atomic war.</p>

<p>Needless to say, police usually side with Fascists and would tend to be blind to this theory. So it may very well be up to us only.</p>

<p>However Fascism is a very dirty word in the world and has many opponents.</p>

<p>The 1965 theory got us to the handler of attacks on us in the UK and Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Let's see where this new theory gets us.</p>
