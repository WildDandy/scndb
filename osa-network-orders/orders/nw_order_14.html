                        <p>We have located the name and address of the enemy and we know exactly who they are.</p>

<p>They pretend to be part of the United Nations, and their various chapters pretend to be part of the national government and, with those pretenses, they collect money. They don't collect slight money; they collect millions and millions and millions. They even have national governments appropriating money to them. They call themselves "national"—National Mental Health Associations—but they are not. Mental Health Associations are part of an organization called the World Federation of Mental Health. They and this was founded in 1904 by a psychotic named Clifford Beers.</p>

<p>It is the group behind the degrees of modern psychiatry. What they do is take mental patients, get them doctors' degrees of some kind or another, make them into psychiatrists and then push the legislatures all kinds of coercive legislation to be able to pick up any man and woman and child on the planet. They defend their right to kill anybody at will—and do—but world couldn't believe that. It is too much. They do not contend this pretenses and libel and slander on Scientology because they have money under false evil. So, we have got them on the nice mild charge of obtaining money under false pretenses.</p>

<p>These guys are terrified down to their boots. They have made up their own chapters dedicated just to the destruction of Scientology. They have meetings on the subject. They are madmen.</p>

<p>They are, oddly enough, connected with international banking. At first glance, it would look like a very formidable enemy. They very often obtain their powers and influence in governments by having the wives and daughters of congressmen, parliamentary members and so forth in their "care." They develop withholds with these characters and then they use these connections to force legislation.</p>

<p>If we start to run the engram of the 4th Dynamic we are of course going to run into the aberration of the 4th Dynamic. And they apparently are the number one aberration on the planet. But they are not really big, they are not really powerful, they are certainly not sensible. And if any outfit was really in its right mind, it would never attack somebody that was not attacking it. So they don't make good sense.</p>
