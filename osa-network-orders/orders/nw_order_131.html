                    </div>

                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>I have no need to stress that this is a terribly important case. Underneath the surface for two decades police and Interpol have been used to spread false and damaging data to the press and governments. This line has been the cause of enormous losses and much labor.</p>

<p>We now have the opportunity to reverse the entire trend of events to such a degree that this could be the last battle of the war.</p>

<p>The strategy I advised had apparently worked: we can now sue the magazine independently, mop up the ground with them and then use them to attack the police in Germany.</p>

<p>The real target is Interpol.</p>

<p>The mechanism of subpoenaing papers, witnesses and depositions can now begin. This is correctly conducted will go like an actual investigation of pulling strings. If the stuff has two objectives, 1) to win ethics cash settlement and 2) to run to earth every contrary criminal conspiracy that has been at work for more than two decades.</p>

<p>If you did not go in for "damage to reputation" and used some other charge like placing in fear and jeopardy by falsifying records and publicizing false records as I have advised your own defense will be minimal and your attack line maximal. I hope my "Suit Caution" arrived in time and was heeded.</p>

<p>Cleverly fought, evidence for a hundred suits in a dozen countries can be gathered in this German police suit. This is the lever that moves the world. Every enemy can be made to stand and deliver.</p>

<p>Any suit you now start can of course be cross-played in what you find about this German suit. Evidence in one area can be used in another and so forth.</p>

<p>Anyone handling this should be familiar with investigatory tech where you pull a string that leads to another string on and on until you find a General Sherman tank.</p>

<p>Unless you sued on damage to repute, your opportunity for PR is endless. And so is your string pulling. Done correctly, the head of the German justice system will resign, the Home Secretary and head of Scotland Yard will also, the FBI and Justice and Treasury principal other very well up in the trend of power. Ethics and drastically reforms. All these apparatus actions directly and your will either fold or go in on the governments, looks at Wategate. You are in Interpol; times is should make the most of it.</p>

<p>The enemy has made a colossal blunder, one of the kind that attorneys pray for. Not only were false reports being made but also illegally publicized. This is the sort of case that comes once in a lifetime.</p>

<p>Only some equally large technical blunder on our parts could lose it. Thus legal tech must be impeccable, no errors, no faults.</p>

<p>The sources of all their reports can be depositioned in addition to the records. And when depositioned, and every deposition becomes B. THEY got it, that can be set up for new deposition. If gained in A names of where they got per jury charge or damages and every evidence gained can get used in bait for a valuable run these attacks down to the record. Where did you get these?</p>

<p>Subpoena the "seventh generation" back.</p>

<p>Pull F, K, P, and L into it. "Where did you get that data?" And F, K, P, and L gives you G, R and J. "Where did you get that data?"</p>

<p>This will work because every one of these poor sods will plead they were innocent by quoting the "authority" from which they got their data. You get the "authority" in each and lay grounds for new suits. It didn't make anyone innocent, the data is false, so they are guilty. But each one will use that plea. So use the plea to get someone else onto the hot seat.</p>

<p>There will be an effort to prove your good faith by claiming that something dimly that way (like the charge) was true. You use this to prove the charge they did publish was false; but the moment they claim ANY error they have pleaded guilty to only slight error, but I am sure they will not be able to resist this temptation, to claiming a false charge.</p>

<p>I trust you were able to sue for a billion. This in itself is PR, but factually these charges have caused far more loss than that. Over the decades.</p>

<p>You are not going to settle for less. You will be forced to continue as long as you can bleed it for more cases. Ultimately you want this case to accept a victory and payoff; won by the fact that the last one before it won more and more cases, each one proven by that time you will have the material for more.</p>

<p>Your real target is Interpol. They are the pipeline. They have violated their charter. You can demand its cancellation as a conspiracy against all honest citizens. You will find that people will spook when it as asserted that THEY are on Interpol records with false charges knocked off the justice Department; this suddenly changed police is being heeded; the "no-too raiders" who were marshals breaking into US homes at first were just shrugged off. Public opinion against secret police and violent police is a dozen of them in the press. Now why you must have PR successful of public reaction. They believe what they read in the press; government are afraid of press out of this, try these marshals have that's been indicted. You must make firms.</p>

<p>Interpol got them to do it? And who got THEM to do it?</p>

<p>Where got offices have been releasing material unbeknownst to us all over the world. Which offices have been releasing material unbeknownst to us all over the world.</p>

<p>You will be pulling the German Interpol office into this almost at once. This office as itself, not as Interpol, can be sued elsewhere. And main Interpol can be sued, and its offices in any country.</p>

<p>You are not pressed for funds. They are at your disposal from any funds. Further, you can get subscriptions from members all over the world when you tell them this was what made it hard on all of us and that it is being remedied.</p>

<p>Various media will get pulled into it. ITV was there somewhere on that info handout which undid any good we did. Their interviewers were sitting sniggering believing themselves safely holding true police reports. Cleverness will count in finding someone admitting they gave out these reports. And there goes ITV, and BBC. You see how the media chain can go.</p>

<p>That is why I was working on the central idea. It is best to estimate which way it went. Well you know of one direction per files and we are getting another.</p>

<p>Scandal will be pulled into this because we knew 6 1/2 million dead jews. They have fought like trapped rats to prevent us because we knew who really und it and the story will be that they were afraid of their press exposure.</p>

<p>So out of this beginning you are going to complete already begun reversal of the trend of the last few years. You are on the upswing already. This is going to send you zooming. This is going to turn from a sneering "those" to "YES sir" to members of the group.</p>

<p>It is axiomatic that he who tames a lion is now the lion tamer. Primitive man, which is to say modern man, turns the skill, victors.</p>

<p>So this one we win. No matter what skill, exactitude, cleverness or boldness that is required, whatever funds are needed, this one we win. For if we win in all its main battles and outlawing skirmishes, we will have won the world, certainly for our field. We have never had any real opponents technically or ethically. Now will we have a long, hard-fought battle and we will have no opponents at all.</p>
