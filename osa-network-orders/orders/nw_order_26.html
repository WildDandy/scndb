                        <p>I found Scientologists do not know (and the world sure doesn’t) the size and state of the enemy.</p>

<p>For years, our orgs have made more in a week than SMERSH does in a year. Two years ago SMERSH was $25,000 in debt with little income in sight. Last year it was far worse.</p>

<p>They closed in Switzerland, moved into a doctor’s private office in Scotland, didn’t have enough to incorporate, are shortly closing that office and are moving to a tiny South American island republic.</p>

<p>Congress holds them in contempt.<br>Their US chapters are “on their last legs.”<br>Their Corfu agent, “Major” Forte, is being fired by the British and has just confessed publicly he was responsible for the trouble we had there and is in fear that people will say he is Scientologists had him removed.<br>Brock Chisholm, their world leader, just died; very few key figures are left.<br>Their mouthpiece, The Daily Mail, has just folded and Peter Younghusband, who caused the Rhodesian upset, has been sacked.<br>We have traced their origins to two years before Hitler and have traced the Nazi death camps and Nazi philosophy to this group.</p>

<p>There were not 200,000 members at their peak.<br>So over the world we outnumber even their rank and file 25 to one at a very low estimate. We could buy all they own out of a week’s income and never miss it.<br>Although a few skirmishes or even battles are still ahead of us, there is now no slightest question as to who is winning this war.<br>The Nazi psychiatrist and Nazi psychologist will most surely go the way of the dinosaur.<br>No, there is no question now as to who will win this war. We will.</p>
