                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>Good news or actions published in the papers should not be kept secret from Scientologists.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of thousands of Scientologists all over the world and they ought to be kept au fait and abreast. You should word it something that survey seems to be about where they live. I would call it something like "The Planetary Campaign," or something of this sort because that word is cropping up on surveys. Maybe, "The State of the Planetary Campaign" or something.</p>

<p>It is like a <strong>GHQ</strong> issues a combat bulletin--how close are they to their objectives and how long is the war.</p>

<p>That is its motif.</p>

<p>It wouldn't say, "Well, we just had a good win and wuff, wuff, wuff." Then we did another one in wuff, wuff, wuff." It would put up a very dangerous face to psychiatry and psychology so that they, picking up a copy of it, would consider us very dangerous to them. The reason that is, whenever they get hysterical, they make many mistakes. And they are typically cowards who can fight as long as they are doing it undercover--but can't stand the light of day.</p>

<p>So you'll get a lot of the things that you are attempting to take over and all of a sudden you'll carry some support. "The drug rehabilitation state in the United States is now 20/50. Twenty states to fifty. We have that many more states to go." "The counseling of American people in difficulties with HUD is this percent over that percent."</p>

<p>It would run such things as "This much money has been spent on psychiatry and it's into the sky!" And you call this "misdirected government financing." And your object is to increase your percentage and you publish the increase of percent.</p>

<p>It has the announced and avowed purpose of just running them all out of business and taking over a monopoly and the whole cockeyed lot. And you'd find the Scientologists all stay up. "Survey shows so," but, "Not, we're fighting a defensible campaign here to back you up and poorly alive," but, "This is how far we've gone now in the conquest of the megatrety." (Except you don't say conquest of the planet" because that sounds too Hitlerian.)</p>

<p>The mental health scene is a broader scene and I would stop using words like "mental health." I'd invent some other term. "Sanity Campaign." All those people are interested in the insane, we're interested in making people sane and making a saner planet." They are interested in this and that.</p>

<p>Get an editor and train him on the line and material.</p>

<p>He's got bounteous just he turns out a little newsletter and it goes around the place.</p>
