                        <p>I can tell you all you want to know about the ethics of this country. They consist of what the royal family believes they are and that is what the ethics are.</p>

<p>You have to look at a control point. Where you have a good solid heavy control, the ethics of the area are what that control believes they are. And if you say they are anything else you are going to "yes man" yourself into the soup.</p>

<p>This is how to be a Hollywood throw man. He is not even vaguely concerned with the Wall Street. He is concerned with what his picture supervisor, who represents this office, can tell him about what the backers believe will "go" at the box office. This puts "him" in the know, and is in the intelligence line. The rest of his intelligence line will make the producer and the front office believe exactly what they think, and that is what goes in. This is the ethic. You find what should be in the picture that he is interested in what is believed, because what is believed will be supported. You can build on what is believed.</p>

<p>The royal family is in control of the country and you must not avoid the fact that they are in control of it. The truth of the matter is, what they say goes. So, if you try to do anything else you will upset the control lines.</p>

<p>This country will only go down if its control line goes out. So, naturally you support its control line. What do they want? What are they trying to do? We’re not quite sure. You could always assume this. There are plenty of advisors around who know, because such an area is absolutely saturated with "yes men." Talk about surveys—it could be done in an evening.</p>

<p>This is the basic formula by which an ethnic survey would finally wind up with a proper answer.</p>

<p>The king is very well respected by the people. It is in that they find that his picture to defend themselves from the secret police. You very often just put up where you see the head of the nation’s picture in the shops. It isn’t just the hopes that when the secret police come in they will be backed off a little bit. (They never are, but there it is.)</p>

<p>The king has a very solid support line.</p>

<p>This idea of doing surveys amongst the locals is for the birds because the king has got this court and control and you don’t care what the people think. You care what the court thinks what the king thinks. So, your ethnic survey is, “What are the king’s and under his intentions and policies?” That’s it. That is your ethnic survey.</p>

<p>What they believe exists as an ethnic action is what they should learn as government. Let us say that it is quite obvious to you that people will agree with English English and be able to do business and they can’t do business because they don’t know arithmetic and that. And the king or the court rightly or wrongly believes that, in spite of the fact that it doesn’t even compare with the computers they are trying to use, Arabic arithmetic is what these people have got. How much agreement you come along and give them some kind of a datum that these people have got to be taught English arithmetic—even though it is a vital necessity to know and use. Now would you think you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>You think you are going to get? The disagreement would be so acute that they do not think you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>It would not matter how clever you were, how convincing you were, how necessary it was—there is a group that does have the country under control. The ethnic values of the country are what that group believes the ethnic values are. Those are the ethnic values you’ll get in. You won’t get in any of the others.</p>

<p>It is not what the ethnic values are, it is what the king and the court believe they are.</p>
