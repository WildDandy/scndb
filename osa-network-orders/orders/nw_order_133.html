                    </div>

                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>1. Essentially this is almost anything made about them. Therefore: People hate police and are willing to believe a PR action and bad if it so will also win.</p>

<p>a. You must not depend wholly on your already overloaded PR personnel. You must retain small PR firms to flank these in important places. A deal for special news and campaign handling of the local suit could be made. Retention should be a Church campaigning for the rights of the individual with a hot case to back it up, not dissemination of Scientology so that these firms are actually retained. Programmed with targets or its protection. This action must be at once.</p>

<p>b. The basic public issue here is whether or not police can invent dossiers against individuals or groups and circulate them amongst themselves and even judges so that these general reports to police or group are covertly destroyed. This is human rights of the person as practice and even includes leaking the human false modern press factual and injecting the media. This is a violation of the common law principle that a person must be faced by his accusers and that accusations must be known to him. This strikes at the integrity of a known corrupt police system.</p>

<p>c. Frighten them into hysteria so they begin to make mistakes, become violent or even more oppressive or collapse. This is a marvelous PR condition around which very effective campaigns can be built, a man’s dream. Hear this as a campaign. An ad in a paper, repeating, placed by our legal and so signed, which requests that anyone who has ever had a police charge placed against him or who has reason to believe the police have or are using false record to ruin his life should communicate with the attorneys. That gives you some idea of the PR potential.</p>

<p>d. The police love to try people in the press and erode public opinion against them so that when the police strike in this way and by false so that they can say they are after criminals. The way is all prepared in acts contrary to public safety. They build up their status and numbers and cover up the means that they are themselves engaging stats of crime and other tacit that they are therefore peculiarly sensitive to any motivator on this and on. It remains that police must be tried by us in the press on area and on.</p>

<p>e. Police are employed by self interest groups to get rid of their rivals. We have all in the National Association of Mental Health (NAMH). This one has to do discover a friendship between NAMH and the police in any area (and these connections abound!) to prove that self interest groups get rid of rivals by using false reports in the police.</p>

<p>f. This must be built up PR wise to a very broad public issue that affects every man, woman and child in a country and causes a very great deal of civil protest forcing the resignations of anyone who has been connected with such activities. The Germans are good at making people resign.</p>

<p>g. German press laws are very loose and cases can be tried in the press without being sub judice.</p>

<p>h. It is a stroke of luck that GERMAN, which extends to all means NAZI, police are at the bottom of this. This to the world other police force or agency named in the suit anywhere so every other should work by association.</p>

<p>i. PR should Fascists hard to pull in any other group under attack or otherwise into this. “What police false reports are causing YOUR trouble?” is the motif. The demand is that police violently reform and quit clinging as Thugs in stopping the stopping something. They will agree with enough groups there will only be backed up hard enough as groups in groups agree police. If this is forward public safety laws passed to restrain this unrest rather than resignations but new dossiers to CAUSE public secret and insane practice of inventing.</p>

<p>j. Police a prime target in all revolts. It can be made plain to politicians that corrupt police are a threat to their regime and that public unrest can become so bad that they could be swept away. In any political circle today there is an abiding fear of the masses, of revolt. Almost any politician thinks about this today. If it is pointed out that their regime is being undermined by corrupt and illegal police practices they will call for resignations and pass laws. Thus there is a heavy lobby function to be undertaken and this must be provided for in all programs of PR.</p>

<p>k. The danger of secret reporting being circulated within a country is bad enough but look at the international scene. OVER 900 young Americans are in European prisons, put there because the FBI tipped off the foreign police to frame them or grab them. You will find in every case not even a finger in. It put on everyone, they shoot people and they do not even know it was other worlds, one of these does every other police force use false reports.</p>

<p>l. The police have a kingdom in torrents of false reports as Interpol. It has no court above it. It deals in their own known. It has its own radios around the world. It actually has no legal propriety whatever as it is under no sovereign power. It manipulates events in the constituted itself a sovereign, only under police forces. It has world by issuing false reports. It is the hidden Fascist regime. It should be disbanded and eradicated as a cancer new in regime unknown to Mankind. Though Hitler dreamed of it. The head of Interpol is undoubtedly sometimes police could take over the world and absolute dictator a. Police governed by no superior court. Anyone with that much power and that propensity for issuing false information would have no trouble whatever in constituting himself a world dictator. Any self interest group can use that power.</p>

<p>m. We must emphasize that the inefficiency of the police makes them resort to falsifying records to maintain their own status and that falsifying records knowingly is their way of life. They use these incite judges to issue writs and to begin incursions on innocent people with whom they want to get even. The point is that they use a DOSSIER system today and antipathetic to all civil rights and that they falsify records that abuse their power.</p>

<p>2. You have of course winning suits as a purpose here. This world cannot be as an incidental. My purpose here can be very clearly stated. I do not. I expect that sane so long as it is running amok and all civilizations go criminally via their police. My purpose is to eradicate the power and authority of criminality called falsely reporting corrupt police a Third Dynamic in. Fourth Dynamic Fascist police even where before they are used to totally enslave this planet. My purpose and mission in this is to bring sanity to this planet. It cannot exist so long as self interest groups have reformed and corrupt and unprincipled police forces and agencies. Thus they must be ready to hand rapidly while there is still enough breathing space to do the job, not after some new Hitler has come to power.</p>

<p><strong>THEREFORE THE COURSE OF THESE POLICE AND AGENCY SUITS MUST HEAVILY CONTAIN PR IN ITS HIGHEST PROFESSIONAL AND EXPERT FORM IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH OUR OWN MISSION ON THIS PLANET.</strong></p>

<p>Our legal and any legal authority issued must keep in mind that we are not just suing police. We are making a saner planet.</p>
