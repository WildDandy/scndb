                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>Black propaganda is a covert communication of false data intended to injure, impede or destroy the activity or life of another person, group or nation, usually issued from a false or removed source from the actual instigator.</p>

<p>It is a specialized technology of its own.</p>

<p>It is used heavily in "psychological warfare".</p>

<p>It relies chiefly on the technique of "classification" of another or a group or a nation as undesirable or evil.</p>

<p>It has many counter weapons for itself essentially fragile because it is false.</p>

<p>Dianetics, Scientology and myself is a very long time have been subjected to a very standard black propaganda campaign instigated by trained persons - the AMA in the US, the British Psychological Association in Australia, the National Association of Mental Health in England and internationally.</p>

<p>What is being attempted by certain propagandists is to classify us firmly in the public mind by constant repetition of black words like "cult". The more we let such propagandists do this, the more chance we give them, the more opportunity they have.</p>

<p>A black artist has to be carefully trained to do this and I am suddenly quite interested in such fellows. It isn't just "the way things are written." Such are well trained intelligence pros in the field of psychological warfare.</p>

<p>Psychiatry today advertises advertising and propaganda and designed of course this campaign we have experienced.</p>

<p>The subject even touched on by Dr. Thomas Szasz as a psychiatric technique in his book Ideology and Insanity, page 49, chapter 4, page 53 section IV, page 67 section IX and his whole article "Psychiatric Classification as Personal Restraint," page 190 of the same book. Of these, page 53 section IV is the most interesting in application to this subject of classification.</p>

<p>Classification is a participation of classification of individuals or groups entails the classification of at least three different types of persons: Social, Act, Classified, and a public called upon to accept or reject a particular classification.</p>

<p>While Szasz is not using it as applies to psychological warfare (black propaganda) or advertising, it is nevertheless a key point in psychiatric planning of any campaign.</p>

<p>The AMA counts on this utterly.</p>

<p>So this is their one trick.</p>

<p>To cancel an enemy’s chief weapon is in itself a part of victory.</p>

<p>To cease to be the effect of classification and become in our turn the cause of it, the classifies, is to win the propaganda game.</p>

<p>Our propaganda is dirty but it is not black because it is true. Black propaganda is essentially false.</p>

<p>We can do this trick by attack and attack. As what is attacked is already popularly evil we become re-classified as attackers and the enemy deal bad hats as they’re for the evil if they won’t be us.</p>

<p>We attack running a black campaign as we deal in truth.</p>

<p>Black campaigns ARC break actions since they depend on false reports and are thus out-R. Hence your dead agent people work.</p>

<p>We just run propaganda campaigns.</p>

<p>The objective is to be identified as attackers of popularly considered evils. This de-classifies us from former labels. It re-classifies our attackers as evil people. Which they are.</p>

<p>In the book Black Boomerang by Seftion Delmer (1962) published by Secker and Warburg, London, Delmer gives various formulas of black propaganda used in WW II. They used intelligence to get enough facts to run a convincing but fake "German radio station" from England.</p>

<p>Since WW II psychiatry has moved its techniques into advertising and propaganda and the think of these is in the Szasz references above.</p>

<p>So we</p>

<p>(1) Seek to avoid opportunities for the enemy to classify us.<br>(2) Contest or expose any previous classification as false (dead agency, etc.).<br>(3) Engage in a series of campaigns which confuse past classification.<br>(4) Achieve for ourselves a dominance in classifying ourselves and others.</p>

<p>Out of this strategic planning can come operating policies and campaigns.</p>
