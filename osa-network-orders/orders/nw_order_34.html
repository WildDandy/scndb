                        <p><strong>POSITIVE POSTULATE</strong></p>

<p>The continuous statement on a positive side about Scientology will overcome any threat thrown at it.</p>

<p>The power of a mass repeated positive postulate is enormous. No negative postulate such as "medicine doesn’t work" is needed. All you have to say is "Scientology works."</p>

<p>No BMA or political group can overcome the cumulative power of this action by us, no matter how much they spend or who or what they bribe.</p>

<p><strong>NO GOVERNMENT PERMISSION</strong></p>

<p>If we stand around and wait for protective laws, nothing constructive will happen.</p>

<p>Giants don’t need protection. There is something deadly about being protected by legislation anyway. Laws stem from public customs. Establish the custom and you can create the law.</p>

<p><strong>A POSITIVE PROGRAM</strong></p>

<p>The whole activity of healing groups derives from their inability to prevent illness. An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure, and also total lack of prevention adds up to BMA and psychiatric millions.</p>

<p>The way to really wipe out the apparent necessity of medicine and psychiatry to harm is to be effective in preventing the power of their use. The larger percentage of the population that remains well, the smaller percentage will patronize totally healing groups like the BMA.</p>

<p>It is within our power to proof Australia against mental and physical illness. This is in itself a good goal and a workable one.</p>

<p>And it is, after all, the best and quickest answer to all threats—be effective.</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>

<p>So let us set our goal for Australia, both to win on all dynamics and to vanquish our enemies.</p>

<p>We have the technology, “they” don’t. We’re the experts. “They” aren’t. “They” could not even copy us for their ethical level is too low.</p>

<p>You could even get the government to cooperate. For it would relieve them of enormous expenses. But why wait on that?</p>

<p>A government today is a political effort to dominate the minds and loyalties of men. Most governments can only act to make men slaves. That makes any political government today a strange bedfellow for Scientologists. We don’t need their help. We are independent people. All we have to do is make our job to make Australia proud and free.</p>
