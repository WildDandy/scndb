<p>Over the years it has been found that the tactics of certain government agencies involve sending plants into our organizations.</p>

<p>The system used by the US government in intelligence matters—all services—is to put a "clean" officer in charge of people with criminal records who have something held over them and who can be used as plants.</p>

<p>This is as antique as other intelligence tech. It is from the Dark Ages. But it permits you to detect one of their plants. Hence it will have some sort of criminal record. Thus if you want to safeguard against plants or narrow down the field, look for criminal connections or records.</p>

<p>If you find a plant and prove that he or she was sent in by some government agency this would then be beneficial in suits against the government. What is really wanted is factual, court-provable evidence that a plant was put in an org by one or another government service.</p>

<p>Plants sing or can be doubled. Sometimes it takes other evidence to back down the blackmail the government has on them. They are not there out of any patriotism. So they turn into victims very easily.</p>

<p>An example of this was a plant who was sent into an organization by a government agency using blackmail. This plant managed to get into a staff position, stole financial records and money from the org and blew. The staff members who were handling this situation used a legal instead of intelligence method of handling—they sued the plant which brought about chaos. A quiet personal touch approach to the plant and the grand larceny threat might have done a great deal while a battering arrest got nowhere. One must realize that arrest processes are not effective today and courts are not trustworthy in such matters—as proven by the high crime rate. Intelligence processes are effective in such matters as they are in effect intelligence matters.</p>

<p>So if you suspect government infiltration, your instructions would be to find, identify and prove a plant if at all possible.</p>

<p>Then use the fact in various suits—but don't sue the plant.</p>

<p>Use him.</p>
