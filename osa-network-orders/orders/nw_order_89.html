                        <p>Write these guys and point out something they know about PR. The repetitive number of times our name has been mentioned all over the world. The number of times our names has been mentioned has been inestimable assistance.<br>"The state of the organization are soating all over or inestimable. The number of times mentioned is invaluable. And we have estimated it and say, "The public that just could not have been purchased any place." Thank them up and it is something that had they just totally disregarded any connected thought they wished to put on papers. All the name and the subject. We can't accommodate the name and the subject and the name remembered the name and the subject, and the numbers of people who are pouring into our organizations all over the world. We have organizations enough. And it's all we've got to over. So thank you very much!"<br>In other words; if you've got a listing to you, enemies which we build had any place, write them a letter if that kind, that they can't do anything with, thanking them to us this enormous boost and assistance, giving them the graphics. They didn't intend to do it for a favor, but they sure did.<br>I've seen it said in Time magazine—they sort of believe this. You could tell them the truth when a bad newspaper story or a bad magazine story has come out, our organizations in the area have boomed.<br>Send them way up above any tone scale they could ever have, just crush them. Write it to everyone who has written an anti-Scientology article—the Ambassador of South Africa that was in Corfu, the cop in Rhodesia, I don't care who. And across the back, staple the graph, something like the growth of the number of Scientologists.<br>Some of them might just walk right outside and blow their brains out. It is hitting at all enemy sources with a backfire. I do not think it would provoke a new attack. They would try to make, here and there, a scornful reference to it or try to refute it.<br>They know—and this is the one you harp on—that it is the repeated number of times you mention a product or a name, that gets PR. And they know, even that. They've mentioned us innumerable times. Why, we do not know nor care. But they haven't managed to get any kind of message connected with it. I wouldn't even point out this error. It's the number of times you mention the name. We just absolutely made this one of the wealthiest organizations, one of the most widely belonged-to organizations that has ever come up the line. Our expenditure on PR has been zero because you've done such a beautiful job of interesting people. Give them total wrong target, wrong intent, failed purposely.<br>Now there is really, really publicity campaign.<br>There is something horrible about a letter coming in from somebody that you hate and have been trying to do down and all of a sudden, you get a letter from him. This in itself is horrible. It's almost as if somebody walked in.<br>They'll probably go, "Ha, ha." Shudder. Somebody would say, "Look, I wouldn't let Mongo in the front office know about this; obviously you've been very ineffective. And I wouldn't let it get around, just counseling." Guys like this always have friends that do them in.</p>
