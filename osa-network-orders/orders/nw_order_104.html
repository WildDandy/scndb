                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>Situations are not being handled by use of the Data Series. We have this tech and it is infinitely useful.</p>

<p>We are evidently running here on a "can't do" on things which, by their having been done, can be done. One never knows legally what can be done until one tries it; gets data; finds what one has to do to do it and then does it. Legal is not a positive subject of blacks and whites; it is an empirical subject. It changes every year due to empiricism practiced in the very courts themselves.</p>

<p>My real purposes in writing this are twofold: to prevent us from making any legal technical errors and to press home the need of the study and use of the Data Series in Legal especially.</p>

<p>You must not assume something cannot be done until you have exhausted every means of getting data on how to do it.</p>

<p>If legal technical errors are made or if outpoints are not noted and handled by evaluation then we can suffer a defeat where we have a clearcut win over the world.</p>

<p>I do not have enough data to do an evaluation on Legal as one document is far from enough. My tentative why would be however that it was using only legal tech and was ignoring Scientology tech such as the Data Series.</p>

<p>My handling would be to make sure that outpoints were noted instinctively; those of ours prevented; those of the enemy used. And that scenes be evaluated before orders are issued into them or about them.</p>

<p>In no way do I wish to have anyone's initiative suffer. Such actions as this require lots of initiative. But let it be exhibited through proper evaluation, done with a full knowledge of the Data Series. Most people do not know that they do not know it; most people think it refines their thinking as the most charitable opinion or rivals at the least. Neither one is true. It is a brand new tool. Man never thought that way and never has. You are about to turn the fantastic advantage over any opponent we have.</p>

<p>You must not neglect this whole course of human history. You may think that is overstating it. Oh, no; it isn't. You are right now being auditors to the central cancer of the planet, secret police. You must be not auditors who yourselves have outpoints in your think. You have to be good, very good indeed.</p>

<p>So be so.</p>
