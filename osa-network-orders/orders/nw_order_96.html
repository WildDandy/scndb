This sort of thing is very hard<br>to study for a casual guy who is negative type of reiterate anyhow—like a government<br>official—and unless you have refutations, it does not communicate as well as it might.<br>It is not a discursive signpost but "You say this—here's that." You say this—<br>here's that." You say this—here's that." It is a statement and a refutation with an<br>approach. But the statement is positive. You say this—here's that." That sort of<br>evidence that it is much more false. It is very orderly.<br>Or you can also do this with color. The allegation is red and the refutation is white.<br>The allegation is white and the refutation is blue.<br>The file says the allegation and then the refutation is crisp. The negative<br>statement followed by the positive refutation; a more impactful pattern, followed at<br>the back with a complete proof to the contrary. At the front or the back there is an<br>index so there is a list of these allegations with complete proof to the contrary.<br>I would propagandize it even further by just calling it "falsehood." Falsehood<br>number so and so, Complete Proof to the Contrary number so and so. One, one, two, two,<br>with the numbers of the documents.<br>And they glance over this and just idly look through and they see bang! "That's true."<br>"That's Dad."<br>A submission of a court suit should be made up that way. A judge has no time<br>to read, he mumbles around, he has misunderstood words—so he just reads "False-<br>hood," "Refutation." "Well, what the hell." A falsehood, where it is. Here, they said that<br>the something or other...and they were on drugs. Here's the refutation. Helped the state<br>of California unearth...<br>and provide "Complete Proof to the Contrary."<br>The documents of their false reports you would label an "Incompetent Report".<br>Somebody looking through that would say, "Where there's smoke, there's fire."<br>There is another thing you do: Make sure you don't give them more information<br>than they already have. So you have to figure out what will make a point with them.<br>Basically, it is a propaganda action or a PR action.<br>Leave no question in anybody's mind.</p>
