                        <p>Some of the enemy's media are getting very loose. We have ruin and should continue to ruin their mass media connections. In the first place, it is idiotic that he has them because he never buys any advertising. All you are to keep saying is just that. You are perfectly safe to attack whatsoever; they never cost you any advertising. They control no media of any kind whatsoever.</p>

<p>So you cut their mass media connections and then establish your own. And it is that little bridge that will be the difference between a Scientology world and a psychiatric one. We are now living in a psychiatric world where all men are animals. Psychiatry and psychology can be killed at will; he's just a pile of meat. Man is a stimulus response thing that is taught even to the grammar school children.</p>

<p>An autocracy is operating completely in the United States and also in England, who abet the psychiatry. You trace what is wrong with this using some kind of terror group called law; you utterly and particularly, and they are planet and you trace it straight to psychiatry.</p>

<p>Their action is interesting: All they use now really are drugs on the insane. That's why they have no sense left in the hospital. A guy comes into the hospital, they hook him with drugs, send him out into the public, and they have officers that enforce the continuous taking of these drugs. They've made a drug addict and now you have a psychotic who is a drug addict. It's a great society.</p>

<p>The government on the other hand is trying to hit people over the head with clubs and arrest them and throw them in jail because drugs are getting very widespread in the society.</p>

<p>The first raid the Narcortics bureau should enter in upon would be the National Institute of Mental Health of the US government. And the first outfits they ought to shut down are the drug companies. They ought to take them right out of the hands of the Mafia. Because I think if you looked up the boards of the big drug companies, you would find nothing but Mafia representatives and nominees. I can't think up a system (it's a sort of a mathematics; you want to know how a system of addiction is done) where you would be getting the widespread distribution of drugs and how it is being done; find out how it's being done; so you try to dream up something as being done, you can't do the world as it exists today, except as it is pushed by a government.</p>

<p>Opum was pushed in on China by the British government and it took the entire might and weight of the British government and the Boxer Rebellion to shove opium down the throats of China. That was how tough it was to make Chinese into drug addicts. Some of the most stellar names you ever heard of in England are directly responsible for the circulation of drugs in China. It's in the Encyclopedia Britannica, under "Opium".</p>

<p>There is other correlative data concerning this. It has to be practically a government-level operation. And the people pushing it the hardest are the psychiatrists. This puts them in a terrible, terrible position. All that has to be done is expose the fact that the psychiatrist is the pusher. Because the public at large is tending to be outraged by this.</p>

<p>If you cut his mass media and expose him as a pusher, he has had it. And if he has had it thoroughly enough, he will make a vacuum. His discrediting and removal will make a vacuum and we are the only group that can be pulled into that vacuum. And this could happen very fast.</p>
