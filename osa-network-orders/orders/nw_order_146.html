                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>I have your scripts on psychosurgery and electric shock convulsions.<br>Both of these scripts are just bare bones horror pictures which do not particularly deliver any message which would assist us.<br>When doing a script of this sort, it has to be plotted in some way to show the enemy in a very bad light to let us ask the question as to what psychiatry has been doing and what it is trying to do.<br>Basically psychiatry has been the tool of persons who are trying to control society. Obviously not to protect it from its insane or criminal members, but to get rid of those who might oppose what they consider, or what some political figure considers his destiny. Although we have Bismarck in one of these scripts pushing Wundt, in the remainder the political background is neglected.<br>Any picture story is trying to teach a lesson and as a parable that will make people back off or will encourage people to do something. In these scripts the psychiatric arguments that it is trying to help people such electric shock is necessary and that psychosurgery is necessary are deeply embedded in the society.<br>Psychiatry is still singing the song that they need more money and more psychiatrists in order to do their job. And the politicians are busily giving them more money.<br>Thus we must actually attach a stigma to any politician who gives any money to a psychiatrist to forward anything and that such a politician is of course an enemy of the people.<br>An exposition of simple cruelty and brutality in the script will not carry the above messages. There is definite complicity on the part of politicians and police forces to knock out anyone in the society they consider odd or different.<br>According to these scripts all these operations could well be performed on the insane because the actors in the scripts are being shown as more or less insane, such as trying to jump out windows or tearing up beds or something of the sort. The burden of it would be that whereas the innocent victim is the hit for racial or political reasons or for familial disagreements so as to magnify the crime, I notice as well that these people are adults these are innocent victims being put to go further, if they were children or old people.<br>For both of these scripts then, we can get a different kind of plot. It is somewhat similar to the plot you were using but it shows a much deeper connivance and a much deeper conspiracy against the people.<br>The Jews were not murdered by psychiatrists because they were insane. A person who simply is confused is not insane. The psychiatrist, in actual fact, could not tell you what an insane person is; he pretends to be the authority on this subject. As a matter of fact, he thinks insanity is some kind of virus or bacteria. He speaks of mental illness, yet nobody has ever located any illness that became insanity.<br>You have made a very limited use of buttons in the following fashion. I myself collided with this problem as there are not too many unwanted buttons. If you keep using helping others or creating new people or a new civilization, you are usually not trying to do that but we are certainly slightly in that direction whether we would or not. I solved this problem earlier by taking negative vital buttons and negative downgrading by inference, or to some slight degree, what we are trying to do. We are good buttons. Some of the buttons you are using are only ten and fourteen percent unwanted buttons which would not have any impact at all. But you take a negative 50% button which, let us say for example, would be "good looks" and reverse it to "ugly appearance" and you now have as many unwanted buttons as you have wanted and vital buttons.<br>A study of the psychiatrist and his wily ways begins actually with the study of the medical doctor in his pretense that he could tell whether a person was actually physically insane or was simply possessed of demons. Dr. Szasz has written a whole book on the subject which is present and he proves beyond any doubt whatsoever that psychiatry grew out of the medical professions. The medical profession in their organization of the AMA has hit us far, far harder than psychiatric organizations. Therefore, you don't keep using the word psychiatrist. You start using the words medical doctor when you're speaking of psychiatric operations.<br>In the Interpol script from WW we have a scene of champagne and posh luncheons while the officers of Interpol planned the construction of the gas chambers to kill six and a half million non-criminal, non-insane people. Therefore we must, very hard, push the idea that the eradication of unwanted minorities and unwanted religious groups is the primary target of the medical doctor who is himself the servant of the insane politician.<br>In South Africa at this very moment, they are solving the racial problem by herding thousands upon thousands of blacks into stockades and keeping them on drugs. They don't give them any mental treatment. They are not insane. There is nothing wrong with them at all. There was some black who objected to being pushed off the sidewalk or who dared raise his voice in the congress for equality.<br>The uses to which psychosurgery is put and the uses to which electro-convulsive therapy has been put are far, far more important in these scripts than mere terror or horror scenes.<br>Therefore, would you please rewrite these scripts, each one of them, from a very tightly conceived plot.<br>It will help you a great deal if you simply make what is called in Hollywood a story outline before the script is actually written as it is much more difficult to write a script and therefore it saves a great deal of time if a very rough one-half page story outline is sent through the lines for OK. That would save you a great deal of work.<br>As long as we have time and we are not shooting, it would be a very good idea to use the time to turn up some bang-o scripts which were very startling and highly informative and would deliver the impact.<br>We have vested interest in knocking out medical doctors and as they are the electric shock since these men are the tools of mad go-go-doctor, psychosurgery the out-ethics segment of the planet.<br>You will understand this better if you realized that we have to get ethics in before we can get tech in. The reason why Scientology is not gone, we're so far out on it, even though it has whatever considerable distance, is because ethics is further than has planet. Therefore, gone a other message being pushed any pushing the basic message of getting ethics in on the planet. Therefore, we shouldn't show these things as simply tolerated and let go. We should show them as something that should be abolished, knocked in the head and swept aside. Not by just making the public upset with the horror of them but with actually showing the public the course of action necessary to take them out of the running, fast and now, before they themselves are totally crushed by one-worlders and other social control groups.<br>Any script that we write in this direction is not in the direction of reform. It is in the direction of eradication. We do not care anything for reformed psychiatrists or a reformed medical doctor or a reformed Interpol. Scripts should be written in the direction that gives them no choice but knock off, quit and go away.<br>You will see from this that the absence of an exposure of these mechanisms, the absence of political connivance and the absence of what we would intend "more money and more psychiatrists," then falls short of public reaction in a.<br>So, remember this form. All of the victims are decent people; all of the villains are evil, insane people. The actions of the victims are sane. The actions of the bad hats are insane. And the bad hats should get their just deserts.<br>It is not impossible to accomplish this sort of thing in the society. We have actually pushed a bill straight on through the California legislature to limit electric shock and psychosurgery and the pressure we have built up over the world are already eroding the power of the psychiatrist and the medical doctor. The high tide of psychiatry was 1958. It has been on the decline ever since, beginning with our killing the great Siberia bill in which any citizen of the United States could be transported to Alaska without even a hearing and held without civil rights forever. He could be sent to Alaska simply by some other person on the street pointing a finger at him. We killed that bill and we fell across their intents and purposes. They have been on the decline ever since. They hold meetings now in psychiatry wondering what is going to happen to them and discussing the certainty that they are finished. The American Medical Association being torn to pieces at this moment by the US Congress. It has lost the bulk of its employees. It is losing the bulk of its membership. It is going to be charged for criminal practices and will probably be in debt tens of millions of dollars it will never be able to repay. So don't think we are not being effective in these campaigns. We are.<br>Therefore our scripts, while not disclosing our role in this, should reflect the success. They should not reflect a terror campaign which is being successful. They should reflect terror campaigns which are failing.<br>I hope this will be of some assistance to you.</p>
