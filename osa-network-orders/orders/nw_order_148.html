                        <p>Reference:<br>HCOB 12 March 1969<br>PHYSICALLY ILL PCS<br>AND PRE OTS<br>Psychiatrists are torturing sick people who could be cured if real medical means were available in institutions which OTS.  KEY ARE NOT. See HCOB 12 March 1969 PHYSICALLY ILL PCS AND PRE OTS.<br>This fact must be stated over and over and over and over (with demonstrations to doctors and to press), paraphrased:<br>"The insane are really sick people in suppressed agony. They can be cured easily using ordinary medical doctor treatment of usual illnesses. But not by psychiatrists. There is no reason to kill the insane. The word is meaningless."<br>This approach can catch on.</p>

<p>THE REAL TARGET<br>I received a report indicating that legislation to require a physical before commitment is to be urged. This is okay for publicity only.</p>

<p>The target of the mission is more, of course, than publicity. I actually intend to force in legislation over the world that every mental home or institution must have a fully equipped clinic with a staff of actual medical doctors.<br>This bares the ugly facts that:<br>A. Mental institutions have no medical care.<br>B. Mental patients receive no medical equipment.<br>C. Psychiatrists are only called MDs, they are not in actual fact capable of bandaging a cut finger and could not practice.<br>D. Psychiatry has no curative or healing intentions.<br>E. As psychiatric patients are merely medically ill this makes the above a crime of magnitude.<br>If we can FORCE equipment and MDs into institutions they will find the patients suffering from tooth breakage and spinal damage caused by shock. This will convince them the patient was physically ill in the first place, which they were.<br>The intent of this mission is not in fact publicity. By getting the backing of equipment firms this mission is to crush the real action through Parliament.<br>This mission is a heavy hussar, actual fact mission. It is to:<br>A. Publicize and effect medical action in institutions and;<br>B. Popularize and get used Dianetics by MDs.<br>Touch Assists are not only used in Scientology orgs. Amongst MDs they can also dig that process.</p>

<p>PRESS<br>If we depend on "newspapers" (propaganda agencies for intelligence services) we will limit our action.<br>Equipment firms and MDs spurred into action by interplaying them and using their parliamentary contacts. This can be done without press if it comes to that.<br>The essence of any such campaign is "who can make dough out of it" to be as crude as it really is.<br>If you hit the equipment houses and get them to hit MDs and Parliament you will actually force the condition into existence and there’s bye-bye psychiatry.<br>Get all the publicity you can and I am sure you will. But shove that mission into action and that factual accomplishment of all institutions with total MDs + Dianetics to attain the finishes psychiatry.<br>Press, as you know, is a broken comm line in many instances. So this is not primarily a press mission.<br>It’s a medical equipment house conspiracy to sell a jillion pounds worth of equipment and put real MDs into institutions. It’s for real.<br>Put this mission into the field, to hell with press, and use it to undermine, press or no press, the whole psychiatric position. In essence it’s an insurgency using finance and carrots to right the wrongness of mental health. But it is, MOST, not press.</p>

<p>SUMMARY<br>That’s the WHOLE campaign. It’s actually a major breakthrough. Simple but actual fact. One hell of a discovery. Psychiatric claptrap about genes and ids is a lot of delusion. The people are simply ill. Medical equipment firms will back this to the limit.</p>
