                        <p>Our information tells us that the associations called "Mental Health" with "National" somewhere in the name are private financing and international entity behind the push on Scientology.<br>Their associates have criminal backgrounds and their directors go high into government.<br>They are however private societies pretending to be government bodies. The UK one runs private mental homes at fantastic costs and profit.<br>They are advertising front for psychiatry and publish booklets urging shock and other brutalities.<br>What we have evidently stumbled upon is a multi-million dollar extortion racket whereby the "patient" or families of the patient are told that unless they pay huge sums for "keep and special care", their loved one will be shocked or operated upon. Their advertising front is usually "National" (though privately owned) and "Mental Healing" committee or society or association.<br>They have no money to burn and so bribe heavily.<br>There is no law legalizing these actions or shocks or operations and "psychiatry" has no basis in law. They get around it by having some partially earned medical degree.<br>Their target is to pretend some group is very bad and then show a "need for law" and so get themselves "regularized" by law.<br>These are the threats of Scientology to them:<br>1. The availability of humane easy treatment would end their racket and profits.<br>2. They seek monopoly and so must end all research by others and stamp out rivals.<br>3. We can discover the truth about such people.<br>4. We are growing and campaigning (mildly) against the brutal treatment of the insane.<br>5. We are not of their political views.<br>6. They attack religion as a primary threat and rival as they are atheists they seek to pronounce any religious person insane.<br>They have political ambitions and pretensions and in many places control parliaments by one or even methods:<br>1. Direct blackmail.<br>2. Putting people into parliament, especially as Ministers of Health.<br>3. Insinuating themselves or their henchmen into the directorates of the larger banks.<br>4. Monopolizing their field press and news services.<br>5. Pretending that slant is very specialized, requires long training and that it cures people and this despite growing numbers of insane in their hands and inability to produce anyone "cured."<br>6. Discrediting all rivals.<br>7. Gradually expanding laws in their favor.<br>They are intensely unpopular with the public yet in England, maintained through the Health Ministry, they control a little man in every town or borough who goes around forcing people in to heavy sedation on threat of shock and sending any who pay to "special care" to the private association homes.<br>This opens the door to political control since if they have the power to pronounce insane or shock or operate upon anyone in the country without outcry they can of course throw a country into any ideology they wish (as they did General Walker and Governor Long in the US).<br>If things go well for them you will soon find:<br>1. A bill legalizing them and cutting down all rivals forever and<br>2. All who disagree with them or stand in the way of their political controlling, or they or their families threatened with the name of "hea pronounced insane and tortured or killed under it.<br>We are watching a mental domination-political link comparable to the church-state collusion of the Roman Catholic Church which gave Europe its autos-da-fe and eventually caused England to revolt under Henry VIII.<br>When some group tries to make the action seem vital and with a threat of pain, duress and terror, it discovers how to dominate individuals' minds any opposition heretical, moves on in the state and takes over.<br>Examples are also the Hashashins, the Old Man of the Mountain, and many, many more are on the Hashashas.<br>If men are given an unlimited legal right to injure or kill without interference by law they of course combine to dominate the state.<br>We have right now this peculiar situation in psychiatry. The "layman" does not look at their statistics and is backed off by a fanfare of technical jargon. The psychiatrist pretends the right to pick up, torture, mentally disable or kill any person and maintains it, despite it being illegal to injure or kill anyone.<br>If anyone tries to testify against them, they say he is insane and have already rigged the law so the testimony of those of "unsound mind" is not valid under law. So who can object?<br>It has taken many years and much intelligence work to get actual cases and facts. We did not suspect or know it when we began and the data collected has only recently fallen into place.<br>Were you to thoroughly investigate these attacks, you would, I am sure, come up with such a group as the National Association of Mental Health and the blackmail they hold over which directors of banks and which ministries. You would also find they are seeking to implement monopoly legislation.<br>We will of course crack all this wide open, being sure of our facts.<br>Their pattern is very similar country to country. They do this in the US.<br>The hypocrisy of anyone saying Scientology is dangerous, when they injure and often kill in their own practice, is of course quite evident. In the very least they shorten people's lives. I never get any but could have usually finished up without losing his boots. Their people never lay for surgery to be re-shocked and always thereafter have to be kept on heavy drugs. As well watch their their "treatments" with idiot who only lives a few years in the most "successful" of their "operations."<br>As it is happening as I write this and as we are under heavy attack and as we do have full data to hand, one can hardly brush this off as fantasy. It proves itself.<br>All we do is seek to raise people's IQ by this philosophy. It attain a higher spiritual awareness. We do not touch or manhandle anyone. We are successful. We do not even treat the sick or insane. To attack us this heavily, at such expense over such a long period, these people who do harm others, injure and kill them and yet protest against us must have some other motive than helping humanity.<br>These people are guilty of the charge: "Seeking to instigate or assist the enactment of legislation by means of libel and slander to obtain a monopoly and control and the right to crush all rivals and disagreements." Any suit you file against such groups or papers must have that in its statement of claim as one of its charges.<br>Why let it happen when all humanity cries out to halt such inhumanity?</p>
