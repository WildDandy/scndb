                        <p>Today, as a culture, we poise on the brink of destruction. It does not matter whether that destruction will come with a dramatic bang or a political upheaval. We cannot, any of us, pretend that all is well or that all is well. It is not so.<br>The turbulence in the society around us is fantastic. There is a danger point below which a society cannot go without reaching a breaking point and going mad.</p>

<p>A society is reduced by the introduction into it of dissatisfied elements. Any society which contains a group (irrational or deranged) is a thing of reason and all entirely aberrated as a society, to a Scientologist.</p>

<p>The government of aberrated (orational or aberrated) members is likely to become problems of government cannot be resolved by reason alone. Barbarism, however, in the world today which cannot be resolved with reason. There is no national problem in solves problems with brutality and with political and social violence. Man’s answer, in his more barbaric stage, was always VIOLENCE. If they wouldn’t bow, scrape, or lick the boots, then violence, was the answer. If you were observed or<br>VIOLENCE. If you were bullied, use VIOLENCE. If they wouldn’t bow, scrape, or lick the boots, then VIOLENCE, was the answer. But with all this violence get Man just Where the A-bomb and H-bomb tour get rimed — back to barbarism; lead, get many</p>

<p>What would you think of an agitator who incited violence against the weak, the helpless, against women and children? Who would you think of someone who solved all his problems by threats of violence? You would be right. Such a person would be insane.</p>

<p>The insane aren’t always stupid but they are certainly insane. Police are continually baffled by the irrationality of such political and racial agitators. Since police officers are, ordinarily, rational men and tend, themselves, towards survival, they sometimes cannot readily comprehend that the agitator habitually takes the route of nonsurvival for himself and his group.</p>

<p>Society is more or less organized on the basis that there are good people and bad people. There are two dominant behavior patterns. There are people who are trying to build things up and others who are trying to tear things down, who are agitating for destruction. It is a problem of divided motives and constructive motives. The basic travail of Man is that he is disastrous those who build and those who demolish, and in this conflict of intentions, whichever side he is on, his fight is always lost. Or lost until the Scientologist came along.<br>A Scientologist is capable of bringing a considerable calmness into an area which is upset. That is the story of Scientology. Behind its progress there is a calmer environment in which a man can live and feel better. There is no doubt that Scientology does work. It calms the environment.</p>

<p>We live in a civilization where some madman can sit in a government chair telling everybody how bad it is over there and then, all of a sudden, get 30 million people killed, as one fellow named Hitler did. We live in a society where political and racial violence can explode at the instigation of mentally disturbed agitators. Is there any hope that the movement towards the destruction of our society can be checked and the tide turned towards construction?</p>

<p>Yes, there is hope. Scientologists are rich in knowing how to exactly handle such circumstances or conditions. Nobody knew before. That is factually true here on Earth. We are the only group on Earth that does have a workable solution.</p>

<p>Scientology handles the basic human behavior for the better. It is a science of life and it works. It does change rules on life and if brings order into chaos. My purpose is to form, here on Earth, a civilization based on human understanding, not violence.<br>A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings have rights, and where Man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology. Nonpolitical in nature, Scientology welcomes any individual of any creed, race or nation.<br>We are working to provide a safe environment in Scientology Organizations everywhere. The dangerous environment of the everyday world, of injustice, sudden dismissals, riots, war, atomic bombs will only persist if we fail to spread this safe environment across the world.</p>
