                        <p>We are kicking on enemy terrain now, inside his National Association of Mental Health. We are fighting him in the teeth. We are not fighting inside a Scientology org now; we're fighting inside the enemy camp and that is where a fight should be conducted. You never fight on your own ground; war is seldom fought on the ground of an ally. And where you should always conduct a war is on the field of an enemy. That is just elementary strategy.</p>

<p>Lenin's think was to conduct political operations on a military basis. I considered this very intriguing because it worked out some time ago that you conducted all legal actions as a military equivalent. It is a successful pattern, but it is unsuccessful to the degree that it attracts and makes active enemies. If you consider that anybody who is powerful is your enemy, if you consider anybody powerful a potential enemy then, of course, you make active enemies.</p>

<p>We were fairly sure before we started kicking the Nats around that they were actual enemies. Although, there is some activity from the American Medical Association we refuse actually to consider the medical doctor an active enemy. So there is something else you can do with this principle—you can also trap an active enemy. He's not that stressed up, you smooth him down put no troops in the field and give him some business. Give him a vested interest in it.</p>

<p>If he's got quite different course but regards to his head and long since would have pursued around had anything well, you boys Stupid be Scientology. He would have the psychiatrist saying, "Yes, well, rock in his diagnostics, take a lot of the fellows that are around, but why don't you send us those that are in a dangerous or horrible condition." And we would have said, "Well, if you promise not to kill them, why, we'll send them to you." And then they would have come out that way and they would not have had any kind of a mess in their field. Because they think like a Russian, all of their action has been in the direction of denying us power. This is the object of a covert operation—the denial of power.</p>

<p>We have tried to parley and they leave you no choice but a frontal attack.</p>
