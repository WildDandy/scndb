                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>Our war has been forced to become "To take over absolutely the field of mental healing on this planet in all forms."</p>

<p>That was not the original purpose. The original purpose was to clear Earth. The battles suffered developed the data that we had an enemy who would have to be gotten out of the way and this meant we were at war. We, a year ago, identified the enemy or at least his central group. Since then we fight based first on our own ground, now on his.</p>

<p>Our tactics of offense and defense are based on data.<br>We need data to predict his offensives and counter them and data to use in our attacks on him.</p>

<p>We remove his agents and vanquish his troops and we directly attack his central group. That's sound tactics.<br>By demonstrating his falsity about us we rehab our own repute. By showing his sources to be false we get them expended.<br>By showing him to be brutal, venal and plotting, we get him discarded.</p>

<p>Our direct assault will come when they start to arrest his principals and troops for crimes (already begun).</p>

<p>Our total victory will come when we run his organizations, perform his functions and obtain his financing and appropriations.<br>We are armed with our own integrity.<br>He is crippled by his subserviences and crimes.<br>We are not effective. Their agents can be "turned" and they are even used to further subversion at high political levels, obvious from their lack of results.</p>

<p>Four countries were totally run by enemy agents in 1939, agents of Adolf Hitler. When he struck, creating an atmosphere of confusion, these high "in place" agents took over. Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and France had Nazi agents at the top. Today's intelligence is patterned on the German service. A similar situation must exist today in the West or the Security Forces would be active instead of hiring as advisors and for their personal placement psychologists and psychiatrists who meet annually with Russian delegates and belong to KGB connected professional institutions.</p>

<p>So this war is relatively unassisted.<br>However, as Sweden does, a small group using good intelligence tactics with good technology, if well organized, can hold back enemies of great size.<br>(1) Good intelligence tactics (we have that).<br>(2) Good technology (we have that).<br>(3) Well organized (we are but could be better).<br>That makes our victory possible.</p>
