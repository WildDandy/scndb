                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>The actions of intelligence are simply to observe, write it up and fire it. That is all intelligence does. And by cross-filing, the answers emerge. That is the whole function of a big intelligence organization.</p>

<p>So observation is basically an intelligence activity.</p>

<p>SOURCES OF OBSERVATION</p>

<p>There are "Legals" and "Illegals"—and it has nothing to do with legality. A Legal is a diplomat attached to the country that somebody who is recognized as an attaché and who has diplomatic standing. And that's all the questions and they come asking some questions. So he legally answers all questions as an Comm. You're through. Or you send out a liaison and he walks in in a Sea Org uniform. And he does a observation. He's a kudos. I'm just using KGB and FBI terminology. This guy is legal. Legal. He's got the mess. He's got the badges. He's got the orders.</p>

<p>And then you have illegals. They call them illegals because if they are picked up, arrested and thrown in jail for the rest of their lives, their country disowns them. That is why they are called illegals—but they are very often reporting to the Legals.</p>

<p>But if an organization went too bad and you don't have much occasion to use Illegals. That's standard intelligence operation. We didn't have any LRH Comm. and you couldn't really get an observation mission and nobody would answer the questions</p>

<p>INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS</p>

<p>Those are your functions and that's all any intelligence office that is worth its salt really does.</p>

<p>Now, the KGB has an operations department, but that's not intelligence. They have to introduce rumors, upsets, and so forth in several. So they use intelligence forces now to expanded intelligence in the *Art of War* back 400 B.C. here.  These types of spy are even discussed by Sun Tzu in the art to cover, back and ward are of talks about the "dead spy" who feeds false information to the enemy and he calls him the dead spy because when the enemy finds out that that's false, they shoot him.</p>

<p>FILES</p>

<p>You actually have the nucleus of an operating intelligence activity. It's by filing that you find out most. So when you put an ethics file way over in some other bureau and it's not comparable to your intelligence files, you can't evaluate information.</p>

<p>If I were running intelligence, I would want them kept up and I would color fight there. I'd want ethics files right there. I'd like green: the international Ethics Files right names with colored pencils on debriefs and like green. This guy has an ethics record as long as your arm. Or a blue circle: He's okay. Red circle: He's upstat. Or any combination of colors.</p>

<p>THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE</p>

<p>Your observer's actions result in intelligence. And then the intelligence officer works. He loses fifteen men there and he estimates the entire force, the number of tanks. He flies mad and he's trying desperately to cut down the German tanks in the middle of the night being massed into parks, the number of artillery being assembled, the number of senriles being increased, the amount of ditches being dug, the amount of trains that have come in with ammunition—and he counts all these things at vast expense. He expends agents like mad. Kaserne says and then he sends them to Dwight "I like Ike" Eisenhower. And Mr. Eisenhower says, "Oh, they've overestimated the situation. Oh, it couldn't be that bad. Ho-ho-ho." And then thinks of another after-dinner story.</p>

<p>And *crash!* The entire force of the German army in North Africa came through the Kasserine Gap with a screaming crash and killed troops by the regiment, it messed up equipment—and near cost them the war!</p>

<p>So your appreciation doesn't necessarily result in an operation. And you know how it comes about? Inaccurate appreciations. If there are too many false reports coming in on the line and you find the situation now and then isn't bad or isn't disturbing, you don't act on them. And then one day you get one that comes through which is very alarming and it's not acted on, and you get a disaster. And this is where intelligence is cross-wired and short-circuited with operations. And they do. They short-circuit.</p>

<p>We depend on volume to give us accuracy. It is very fatal to act on just little isolated reports. So we get volume and we've been operating under that and we're starting to get actual observation in. Previous to that time you were actually operating on intuition.</p>
