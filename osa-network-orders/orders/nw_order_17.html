                        <p>PSYCHIATRIC FRONT GROUPS</p>

<p>In Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, chapter on "The Mind's Protection", you will find a mild remonstrance against psychic electric shock and surgery. It states: "There are probably thousands of ways to get into trouble with mental healing, but all these ways can be classed in these groups: (1) use of shock or surgery on the brain; (2) use of strong drugs; (3) use of hypnosis as such; and (4) trying to crossbreed Dianetics with older forms of therapy."</p>

<p>This was in 1950. Within 3 months of its appearance the book was under violent irrational attack by psychiatry actually or a bill half through the US Congress authorizing a "Siberia" psychiatrically for children.</p>

<p>In the late '50s any man, woman and girl could be seized and sent without trial to Alaska, deprived of any and civil rights and detained forever, all without trial or examination.</p>

<p>The Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, DC caught wind of this bill and instantly mobilized US civic groups and defeated it.</p>

<p>These marked Scientology for slaughter in the books of these madmen.</p>

<p>As recently as 1968 the same international psychiatric group was trying to push the same "Siberia Bill" through the New Zealand Parliament.</p>

<p>Kenneth Robinson, former Minister of Health in the ... and vice president of a branch of this psychiatric front group, is the one who began trouble for Scientology Churches in the UK.</p>

<p>Robinson, in his book ... for despatch to death camps, advocates personally the easy seizure of anyone in the ... published by this front group.</p>

<p>Press chains headed by men who were also directors of the psychiatric front group, Cecil King and Sir William Carr, kept pounding at Scientology, urging "official action", trying to build up an anti-Scientology public opinion step by step.</p>

<p>Any other hostile actions toward Scientology build back and obliterate, to the same group.</p>

<p>Scientology has fought a consistent and winning battle for human rights for two decades.</p>

<p>During that entire time, not one crime has been found in Scientology.</p>

<p>But during that time psychiatry has seized and killed tens of thousands of people they don't like.</p>

<p>It is said Scientology's wives "necessary treatment." But psychiatrists call their own rape and death of men's weak families. It doesn't.</p>

<p>Any type of crime this psychiatric group accuses the Scientologists of has now been traced back to be standard psychiatric practice.</p>

<p>Being slightly more than mad, these fellows are trying to put public attention on an innocent group to distract attention from their own brutal and perverted activities. By saying someone else does these things they think the public will believe the psychiatrists a lofty public spirited paragon of virtue.</p>

<p>The public is not fooled. They detest psychiatry. 47% of people with mental trouble go to their clergymen. 28% go to their general practitioner. The psychologist and psychiatrist, between them, only get 16% of the "trade".</p>

<p>To enlarge their sphere the psychiatrist plans to knock out all churches in the field of mental healing. There reference is the World Health Organization Technical Report Series. No. 98, Legislation Affecting Psychiatric Treatment, July 1955.</p>

<p>Scientology is their first target. If they win there they will take on other churches and so build their empire.</p>

<p>The only puzzle in all this is how does the psychiatrist influence governments?</p>

<p>As a terror symbol? By blackmail of politicians using confession data of wives? Holding politicians' family members hostage? By bribery?</p>

<p>The psychiatrist, handling, for this he gives no "trade", yet obtains hundreds of millions annually over the world. Almost none of the service, injures or kills his patients, seeks to seize anyone and everyone at a whim, yet is strangely immune from the correct murder charges. Not even a medical doctor is allowed to kill people.</p>

<p>How could the allied nations hang Germans at Nuremberg for these crimes and yet award heavy appropriations at home to run their own death camps?</p>

<p>Scientology continues to demand human rights for all men and continues to defy these psychiatric front groups.</p>

<p>The world today will not stand for such flagrant rights violations as the psychiatrists demand. The world today will not stand for death camps, human experiments, torture and murder.</p>

<p>The Scientologists are fighting this and will fight it down to a final and complete victory over the powers of evil.</p>

<p>Some day even the press, even politicians will wake up and say "Hey! These are the guys in the good hats!"</p>

<p>Or else the press and politicians were the bad hats all the time.</p>

<p>The century has a long way to run.</p>

<p>The public has already realized the Scientologists are good people.</p>
