                    <div class="document-text">
                        <p>In the First Amendment, it states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Psychiatry and psychology and others in government make organized attacks upon religion. Most of the time these are not even masked by the excuses that the religionists are doing wrong.</p>

<p>All such psychology and psychiatric groups of today and individuals amongst them have engaged in outright anti-religious campaigns.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health embraces these groups.</p>

<p>If Congress appropriates one penny to finance any such group or program or even if paying the salary of a psychiatrist or psychologist who does, then Congress quite visibly is passing a law (finance) in respect of religion and is financing the attack on the free exercise thereof.</p>

<p>A program to isolate anti-religious statements or opinions expressed by any person and government pay or financed in any way by the government, which would then detail and authenticate these statements or participations, could result in a body of evidence. The investigation and summary could include the government agencies that have attacked and harassed religion.</p>

<p>A suit, based on the evidence, could be filed against Congress for violating the First Amendment by financing such persons or groups.</p>

<p>If done correctly, all financing by the federal government of all psychological and psychiatric groups and personnel would come to an end.</p>

<p>The gag and their groups as they are not religious. This finance psychology and psychiatry is being worked as the moral structure of the country. Today churches out in the cold, which is being downed is that the government works to leave children are no longer taught morals in school due to the activities of the psychologists and psychiatrists and their attacks on religion.</p>

<p>In the Kentucky findings, the woman, who brought the suit against Kentucky to prohibit the Ten Commandments from being posted in classrooms, required a lot of financial help to get it before the Supreme Court. It is possible that psychiatric or psychological money was clear to that action.</p>

<p>The strategy of such groups is that if it knocks out religion, it is left with the government finance. a death blow to both those professions if they no longer had any bucks. It would beg.</p>

<p>Psychology and psychiatry are very active lobbyists in all legislatures. No one has exposed the fact that they are also the very active anti-religionists and quite outspoken about it. Their textbooks deny God.</p>

<p>The body of potential evidence is huge.</p>

<p>This observation penetrates an apparent strategy to attack churches and deny them financing, which finance then accrues to the psychological and psychiatric professions. They had even connected the ministers of Washington, DC in the '50s into sending their parishioners to the shrinks.</p>

<p>A finance from the government is the lifeline of these groups and personnel, a successful series of suits could end them.</p>

<p>Nothing in this suggestion implies any illegal action.</p>

<p>If just one man on a government payroll has made a statement tending to suppress the free exercise of religion, the suit could be won.</p>

<p>As there have been thousands of such men and statements, the suit is a piece of cake.</p>
