### Button Type Distinctions
- `.search-btn, .clear-btn` → Use direct hex colors (#00ff41, black, white) 
- `.nav-btn` → Use CSS variables with transform hover effects
- `.clear-button` → Glossary-specific with !important overrides
- Different hover behaviors are intentional - don't standardize them
