name: CSS Rules
---

- Use tokens from :root in base.css.
- No new global CSS variables.
- No !important unless already in system.
- Do not modify shared CSS directly unless updating system-wide.
- Use .clean-view for clean theme overrides.
### Button Type Distinctions
- `.search-btn, .clear-btn` → Use direct hex colors (#00ff41, black, white) 
- `.nav-btn` → Use CSS variables with transform hover effects
- `.clear-button` → Glossary-specific with !important overrides
- Different hover behaviors are intentional - don't standardize them
