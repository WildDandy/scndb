# .cursorrules – OSA_Site

This folder defines **Cursor rules** for the OSA_Site project.  
Each `.mdc` file contains short, directive rules for a specific domain.

## Master Template System
The **authoritative template** exists in the shared/templates folder:

- **shared/templates/master-layout.html** → unified template with placeholder variables for all page types.

- **shared/templates/README.md** → comprehensive documentation of the template system.

- **shared/templates/USAGE.md** → implementation guide with path examples.

This template **can be updated centrally** if design changes are needed. All pages must follow the placeholder variable system and class naming conventions.


## Files in This Folder
- **html.mdc** → HTML structure, includes, templates

- **css.mdc** → CSS usage, variables, restrictions

- **js.mdc** → JavaScript rules, allowed APIs, structure

- **pages.mdc** → Rules for index, glossary, search results, and order pages

- **accessibility.mdc** → ARIA, keyboard navigation, accessibility score

- **paths.mdc** → Relative paths by depth (root, nested, deep nested)

- **theme.mdc** → Theme handling, default mode, FOUC prevention

- **responsive.mdc** → Responsive behavior and breakpoints

- **checklist.mdc** → Commit checklist before merging

- **prompts.mdc** → Ready-to-use Cursor prompts for common tasks


## Usage
1. Place `.cursorrules/` at the root of the project.

2. Cursor automatically reads `.mdc` files for AI guidance.

3. Always follow **master templates** as the source of truth.

4. Use **prompts.mdc** for quick, repeatable tasks.


## Principles
- **Single Source of Truth** → Use shared templates, CSS, JS.

- **Consistency** → Same structure across all mini-sites.

- **Accessibility** → Always keep keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.

- **No Inline Styles** → Only use shared CSS.

- **Default Clean Theme** → Prevent FOUC and keep clean view as default.
